<h4><a name = "widow_arg" id = "widow_arg">ARGUMENT.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">Bacon</span>, General of the English in
Virginia, has fought with great success against the Indians and
repeatedly beaten back their tribes, although the Supreme Council, by
whom the Colony is governed, have refused him a commission, and, in
spite of his victories, persist in treating him as a rebel and a
traitor. This Council indeed is composed of a number of cowards and
rogues, who through sheer malice and carping jealousy attribute Bacon’s
prowess to his known passion for Semernia, the Indian Queen, and who
feign to think that he fights merely with the hope of slaying her
husband, the King Cavernio. These rascals are none the less mightily
afraid of the general’s valour and spirit, so they determine to entice
him from his camp under various specious pretexts, and then, once he is
completely in their power, to have him executed or assassinated. With
this object in view they send a friendly letter asking him to attend the
Council, to accept a regular commission, and to raise new forces. On his
way to the town Bacon is attacked by an ambush of soldiers, whom he
beats off with the help of one of his lieutenants, Fearless, backed by
Lieutenant Daring and a troop of his own men, who capture Whimsey and
Whiff, two very prominent justices, instigators of the plot. He
accordingly appears before the Council with a couple of prisoners. The
populace, who are all for their hero, realizing the treachery, raise a
riot, and throw the Councillors into a state of the utmost confusion and
alarm. They spur themselves to action, however, and under the leadership
of Colonel Wellman, Deputy Governor, proceed to take the field against
Bacon, who is declared an open and lawless rebel. When he appears the
soldiers, none the less, join themselves to their hero, and as at the
same moment news is brought that the Indians have risen and are
attacking the town, Bacon is induced to lead the troops against the foe;
and in a pitched battle Cavernio is slain. That night whilst his army is
revelling after their victory the Council and their party with infamous
treachery suddenly attack the camp. There are further skirmishes with a
remnant of the Indian fugitives, and in one of these frays Bacon
accidentally wounds Semernia, who is flying disguised in man’s attire.
He recognizes her voice, and she sinks into his <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘ams’">arms</ins> to die. As he is
weeping over her body Fearless rushes in with drawn sword shouting that
the day is all but lost. Bacon, his mistress dead, deeming that his men
are overcome by the attack from the town and that he will himself be
captured, takes poison which he carries concealed in the pommel of his
sword, whilst Daring and his soldiers are heard shouting ‘Victory!
Victory!’ The hero, however, expires at the moment his men have
conquered, but the Council speedily come to terms, naming with a
commission Daring as General, whilst Colonel Wellman announces his
intention of weeding this body of rogues and cowards against the arrival
of the new Governor who is expected from England.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">218</span>
<p>Daring, upon his commission, is wedded to the Widow Ranter, first
mistress and then wife of old Colonel Ranter, recently deceased,
a&nbsp;wealthy, buxom virago who has followed her soldier during the
fighting in man’s attire and even allowed herself to be taken prisoner
by a young gallant, Hazard, just landed from England, and who has
occupied his time in an amour with a certain Mrs. Surelove. Hazard, upon
his arrival, meets an old acquaintance, Friendly, who loves and is
eventually united to Crisante, daughter to Colonel Downright; whilst
Parson Dunce, the Governor’s chaplain, is made to marry Mrs. Flirt, the
keeper of a hostelry, a&nbsp;good dame with whom he has been a little
too familiar on a promise of matrimony.</p>


<h4><a name = "widow_source" id = "widow_source">SOURCE.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">The</span> admirable comic scenes and
characters of <i>The Widow Ranter</i> are original invention, but Mrs.
Behn has founded the serious and historical portion of her play upon a
contemporary pamphlet, <i>Strange News from Virginia being a full and
true account of the Life and Death of Nathaniel Bacon esq. London:
printed for Wm. Harris, 1677</i>. With regard to the catastrophe and
Bacon’s love for the Indian Queen, Mrs. Behn has quite legitimately
departed from the narrative, but otherwise she keeps fairly closely to
her sources. There is also a <i>History of Bacon and Ingram’s Rebellion
in Virginia in 1675-76</i>, written at the time but first published in
1867.</p>

<p>The <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> gives a very ample yet
concise account of Bacon, with valuable references to original
documents. He was the son of Sir Thomas Bacon of Friston Hall, Suffolk.
Born in 1642, about 1673 he married Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Edward
Duke, Bart., and shortly afterwards in a spirit of roving adventure
emigrated to Virginia. Here he was elected a member of the Council, and
his estates being especially exposed to Indian raids the volunteer
colonists chose him General. The Governor, however, delayed to send the
necessary commission, and Bacon having in this interval attacked a band
of Indian marauders was promptly declared a rebel. The Governor was
thereupon forced to yield by a general revolt, and in a second
expedition Bacon defeated the Indians with terrific slaughter.
A&nbsp;little later when reinforcements had arrived the Governor again
declared him an outlaw, but after a brief struggle was himself obliged
to take refuge at sea, whilst Jamestown fell into the hands of the
victorious General, who not being able to garrison the houses, burned it
to the ground. In the midst of his success, whilst he was busied with
new plans for the welfare and protection of the colonists, Bacon died
suddenly, 1676. He left one daughter, Mary, who married Hugh
Chamberlain, M.D., physician to Queen Anne. Mrs. Behn has drawn his
character with remarkable accuracy. Even his enemies were obliged to
allow he possessed extraordinary ability, and he won all by the grace
and charm of his manner. Oldys, in a MS. note on Langbaine (Mrs. Behn),
attributes to the colonist <i>A&nbsp;Historical Discourse of the
Government of England</i> (1647), but the date of publication
sufficiently shows that the antiquary is palpably in error.</p>

<p>Langbaine in his note on <i>The Widow Ranter</i> abruptly and
sweepingly remarks ‘Plot from the known story of Cassius,’ which the
<i>Biographia
<span class = "pagenum">219</span>
Dramatica</i> yet more erroneously expands as follows: ‘The tragedy part
of it, particularly the catastrophe of Bacon, is borrowed from the
well-known story of Cassius, who, on the supposition of his friend
Brutus being defeated, caused himself to be put to death by the hand of
his freedman Dandarus.’ C.&nbsp;Cassius Longinus was defeated at
Philippi (<span class = "smallroman">B.C.</span> 42), by Antony, and
ignorant that the left wing commanded by Brutus had conquered Octavius,
he straightway commanded his freedman Pindarus to put an end to his
life. It is strange that both authorities should have made this mistake,
the more so as Bacon expressly alludes to the fate of Hannibal, from
whose history, and not that of Cassius, Mrs Behn doubtless borrowed the
idea of her hero’s suicide. Cassius is indeed alluded to but casually,
and not by Bacon’s self. Hannibal had fled to the court of Prusias, King
of Bithynia, who, unable to resist the demands of the Romans, eventually
sent troops to arrest his guest. The great Carthaginian, however, having
provided himself with poison in case of such an event, swallowed the
venomed drug to prevent himself falling into the hands of his enemies.
Dullman, Timorous Cornet, Whimsey, Whiff, and the other Justices of the
Peace who appear in this play are aptly described in <i>Oroonoko</i>,
where Mrs. Behn speaks of the Governor’s Council ‘who (not to disgrace
them, or burlesque the Government there) consisted of such notorious
villains as Newgate ever transported; and, possibly, originally were
such who understood neither the laws of God or man, and had no sort of
principles to make them worthy of the name of men; but at the very
council-table would contradict and fight with one another, and swear so
bloodily, that it was terrible to hear and see them. (Some of them were
afterwards hanged, when the Dutch took possession of the place, others
sent off in chains.)’</p>


<h4><a name = "widow_hist" id = "widow_hist">THEATRICAL
HISTORY.</a></h4>

<p>When <i>The Widow Ranter; or, The History of Bacon in Virginia</i>
was produced at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in 1690&mdash;the year
after Mrs. Behn’s death&mdash;owing to the slipshod and slovenly way in
which it was put on, or rather, ‘murdered’, to use the phrase of the
dedication, it did not meet with the success so capital a piece fully
deserved. Such ample and needless omissions were made that the intrigue
soon became hopelessly fogged, many incidents seeming absolutely
disjointed and superfluous. For not only were heavier scenes, including
the apparition of Cavernio, cut, but the essential comic relief was
woefully maltreated. The Court House opening of Act iii was expunged in
its entirety, whilst other episodes were so mangled and the speeches so
pruned that they proved practically unintelligible. Again, the play was
badly cast. Indifferent performers such as Barnes, Baker, Cudworth, were
entrusted with rôles they were incapable of acting, whilst Daring, the
dashing, gallant, and handsome young officer, who is loved by the Widow,
was alloted to Sanford, of all men most supremely unfitted for the part.
Indeed, it would seem that the casting was done on purpose perversely
and malignly to damn the play. Samuel Sanford, who had joined Davenant’s
company within a year of their opening, had been forced by nature, being
low of stature and crooked of person, rather than by choice, into a line
denoted by such characters as Iago, Creon in
<span class = "pagenum">220</span>
Dryden and Lee’s <i>Oedipus</i>, Malignii, Osmund the wizard in <i>King
Arthur</i>. ‘An excellent actor in disagreeable characters’ Cibber terms
him, and old Aston sums him up thus: ‘Mr. <i>Sanford</i>, although not
usually deem’d an Actor of the first Rank, yet the Characters allotted
him were such, that none besides, then, or since, ever topp’d; for his
Figure, which was diminutive and mean, (being Round-shoulder’d,
Meagre-fac’d, Spindle-shank’d, Splay-footed, with a sour Countenance and
long lean Arms) render’d him a proper Person to discharge <i>Jago</i>,
<i>Foresight</i> and <i>Ma’lignij</i>, in the <i>Villain</i>.&mdash;This
Person acted strongly with his Face,&mdash;and (as King <i>Charles</i>
said) was the best <i>Villain</i> in the World.’ The performance of an
actor with such a marked personality and unpleasantly peculiar talents
as are thus enumerated, in the rôle of Daring must been grotesque and
distasteful to a degree. In such an accumulation of unfortunate
circumstances there could have been no other event than the failure of
the play, which was so complete as effectually to bar any chance of
subsequent revival. Indeed, there seems to have been only one feature of
any merit: Betty Currer, the original Aquilina in <i>Venice
Preserv’d</i>, acted the name part with the greatest spirit and
abandon.</p>

<p>Madam</p>

<p>Knowing Mrs. <i>Behn</i> in her Life-time design’d to Dedicate some
of her Works to you, you have a Naturall Title, and claim to this and I
could not without being unjust to her Memory, but fix your Name to it,
who have not only a Wit above that of most of your Sex; but a goodness
and Affability Extreamly Charming, and Engaging beyond Measure, and
perhaps there are few to be found like you, that are so Eminent for
Hospitallity, and a Ready and Generous Assistance to the distress’d and
Indigent, which are Quallities that carry much more of Divinity with
them, than a Puritannicall outward Zeal for Virtue and Religion.</p>

<p>Our Author, Madam, who was so true a Judge of Wit, was (no doubt of
it) satisfyed in the Patroness she had pitcht upon: If ever she had
occasion for a Wit and Sense like yours ’tis now, to Defend this (one of
the last of her Works) from the Malice of her Enemies, and the ill
Nature of the Critticks, who have had Ingratitude enough not to Consider
the Obligations they had to her when Living; but to do those Gentlemen
Justice, ’tis not (altogether) to be Imputed to their Critticism, that
the Play had not that Success which it deserv’d, and was expected by her
Friends; The main fault ought to lye on those who had the management of
it. Had our Authour been alive she would have Committed it to the Flames
rather than have suffer’d it to have been Acted with such Omissions as
was made, and on which the Foundation of the Play Depended: For Example,
they thought fit to leave out a Whole Scene of the <i>Virginian Court of
Judicature</i>, which was a lively resemblance of that Country-Justice;
and on which depended a great part of the Plot, and wherein were many
unusuall and very Naturall Jests which would at least have made some
sort of People laugh: In another Part of the Play is Omitted the
appearance of the Ghost of the <i>Indian King</i>, kill’d by
<i>Bacon</i>, and tho’ the like may have been Represented in other
Plays, yet I never heard or found but that the sight was very agreeable
to an Audience, and very Awfull: besides the Apparition of the Ghost was
necessary, for it was that which struck a Terror in the Queen, and
frighten’d her from heark’ning to the Love of <i>Bacon</i>, believing it
a horrid thing to receive the Caresses and Embraces of her Husbands
Murderer: And Lastly, many of the Parts being false Cast, and given to
<span class = "pagenum">222</span>
those whose Tallants and Genius’s suited not our Author’s Intention:
These, Madam, are some of the Reasons that this Play was unsuccessfull,
and the best Play that ever was writ must prove so: if it have the Fate
to be Murder’d like this.</p>

<p>However, Madam, I can’t but believe you will find an hours diversion
in the reading, and will meet with not only Wit, but true Comedy, (tho’
low) by reason many of the Characters are such only as our
<i>Newgate</i> afforded, being Criminals Transported.</p>

<p>This play, Madam, being left in my hands by the Author to Introduce
to the Publick, I&nbsp;thought my self oblig’d to say thus much in its
defence, and that it was also a Duty upon me to choose a Patroness
proper for it, and the Author having pitcht upon your Name to do Honour
to some of her Works, I&nbsp;thought your Protection, could be so
usefull to none, as to this, whose owning it may Silence the Malice of
its Enemies; Your Wit and Judgment being to be Submitted to in all
Cases; Besides your Natural Tenderness and Compassion for the
Unfortunate, gives you in a manner another Title to it: The Preference
which is due to you upon so many Accounts is therefore the Reason of
this present Address, for at the Worst, if this Play should be so
Unfortunate as not to be thought worthy of your Acceptance; Yet it is
certain, that its worth any Man’s while to have the Honour of
subscribing himself,</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
<i>Hazard</i>, my Friend! come to my Arms and Heart.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Haz.</span>
This unexpected Happiness o’erjoys me. Who could have imagin’d to have
found thee in <i>Virginia</i>? I&nbsp;thought thou hadst been in
<i>Spain</i> with thy Brother.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
I was so till ten Months since, when my Uncle Colonel <i>Friendly</i>
dying here, left me a considerable Plantation; and, faith, I&nbsp;find
Diversions not altogether to be despis’d; the God of Love reigns here
with as much power as in Courts or popular Cities. But prithee what
Chance (fortunate to me) drove thee to this part of the new World.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Haz.</span>
Why, faith, ill Company, and that common Vice of the Town, Gaming, soon
run out my younger Brother’s Fortune: for imagining, like some of the
luckier Gamesters, to improve my Stock at the <a class = "comm" name =
"widow_commtag6" id = "widow_commtag6" href = "#widow_commnote6">Groom
Porter’s</a>, <a class = "notes" name = "widow_texttag8" id =

lost all. My elder Brother, an errant Jew, had neither Friendship nor
Honour enough to support me; but at last being mollified by Persuasions,
and the hopes of <a class = "notes" name = "widow_texttag9" id =
"widow_texttag9" href = "#widow_textnote9">being</a> for ever rid of me,
sent me hither with a small Cargo to seek my Fortune&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
And begin the World withal.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Haz.</span>
I thought this a better Venture than to turn sharping Bully, <a class =
"notes" name = "widow_texttag10" id = "widow_texttag10" href =
"#widow_textnote10">Cully in</a> Prentices and Country Squires, with my

night at the Groom-Porter’s, begging his Honour to go a Guinea the
better of the lay. No, <i>Friendly</i>, I&nbsp;had rather starve abroad,
than live pity’d and despis’d at home.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
Thou art in the right, and art come just in the nick of time to make thy
Fortune.&mdash;Wilt thou follow my Advice?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Haz.</span>
Thou art too honest to command <a class = "notes" name =
"widow_texttag11" id = "widow_texttag11" href = "#widow_textnote11">any

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
You must know then, there is about a Mile from <i>James-Town</i> a young
Gentlewoman&mdash;no matter for her Birth, her Breeding’s the best this
World affords, she is married to one of the richest Merchants here; he
is old and sick, and now gone into <i>England</i> for the recovery of
his Health, where he’ll e’en give up the Ghost: he has writ her word he
finds no Amendment, and resolves to stay another Year. The letter I
accidentally took up, and have about me; ’tis easily counterfeited, and
will be of great use to us.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Haz.</span>
Now do I fancy I conceive thee.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
Well, hear me first, you shall get another Letter writ like this
Character, which shall say, you are his Kinsman, that is come to
traffick in this Country, and ’tis his will you should be received into
his House as such.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Haz.</span>
Well, and what will come of this?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
Why, thou art young and handsome, she young and desiring; ’twere easy to
make her love thee; and if the old Gentleman chance to die, you guess
the rest, you are no Fool.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Haz.</span>
Ay, but if he shou’d return&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
If&mdash;Why, if she love you, that other will be but a slender Bar to
thy Happiness; for if thou canst not marry her, thou mayst lie with her:
and, Gad, a&nbsp;younger Brother may pick out a pretty Livelihood here
that way,
<span class = "pagenum">229</span>
as well as in <i>England</i>. Or if this <a class = "notes" name =
"widow_texttag12" id = "widow_texttag12" href =
"#widow_textnote12">fail, thou</a> wilt find a perpetual Visiter, the
Widow <i>Ranter</i>, a&nbsp;Woman bought from the ship by old Colonel
<i>Ranter</i>; she served him half a Year, and then he marry’d her, and
dying in a Year more, left her worth fifty thousand Pounds Sterling,
besides Plate and Jewels: She’s a great Gallant, but assuming the humour
of the Country Gentry, her Extravagancy is very pleasant, she retains
something of her primitive Quality still, but is good-natur’d and
generous.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Haz.</span>
I like all this well.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
But I have a further End in this matter; you must know there is in the
same House a young Heiress, one Colonel <i>Downright’s</i> Daughter,
whom I love, I&nbsp;think not in vain: her Father indeed has an
implacable Hatred to me, for which reason I can but seldom visit her,
and in this Affair I have need of a Friend in that House.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Haz.</span>
Me you’re sure of.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
And thus you’ll have an opportunity to manage both our Amours: Here you
will find occasion to shew your Courage, as well as express your Love;
for at this time the <i>Indians</i>, by our ill Management of Trade,
whom we have armed against our selves, very frequently make War upon us
with our own Weapons; though often coming by the worst, they are forced
to make Peace with us again, but so, as upon every turn they fall to
massacring us <a class = "notes" name = "widow_texttag13" id =
"widow_texttag13" href = "#widow_textnote13">wherever</a> we lie exposed
to them.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Haz.</span>
I heard the News of this in <i>England</i>, which hastens the new
Governour’s arrival here, who brings you fresh Supplies.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
Would he were landed, we hear he is a noble Gentleman.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Haz.</span>
He has all the Qualities of a Gallant Man: besides, he is nobly
born.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
This Country wants nothing but to be peopled with a well-born Race, to
make it one of the best Colonies in the World; but for want of a
Governour we are ruled
<span class = "pagenum">230</span>
by a Council, some of <a class = "notes" name = "widow_texttag14" id =
"widow_texttag14" href = "#widow_textnote14">whom</a> have been perhaps
transported Criminals, who having acquired great Estates, are now become
your Honour and Right Worshipful, and possess all Places of Authority;
there are amongst them some honest Gentlemen, who now begin to take upon
’em, and manage Affairs as they ought to be.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Haz.</span>
<i>Bacon</i> I think was one of the Council.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
Now you have named a Man indeed above the common Rank, by Nature
generous, brave, resolv’d and daring; who studying the Lives of the
<i>Romans</i> and great Men, that have raised themselves to the most
elevated Fortunes, fancies it easy for ambitious Men to aim at any pitch
of Glory. I’ve heard him often say, Why cannot I conquer the Universe as
well as <i>Alexander</i>? or like another <i>Romulus</i>, form a new
<i>Rome</i>, and make my self ador’d?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Haz.</span>
Why might he not? Great Souls are born in common Men sometimes, as well
as Princes.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
This Thirst of Glory cherish’d by sullen Melancholy, I&nbsp;believe, was
the first motive that made him in love with the young <i>Indian</i>
Queen, fancying no Hero ought to be without his Princess. And this was
the reason why he so earnestly press’d for a Commission, to be made
General against the <i>Indians</i>, which long was promis’d him; but
they fearing his Ambition, still put him off, till the Grievances grew
so high, that the whole Country flock’d to him, and beg’d he would
redress them.&mdash;He took the opportunity, and led them forth to
fight, and vanquishing brought the Enemy to fair Terms; but now instead
of receiving him as a Conqueror, we treat him as a Traitor.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Haz.</span>
Then it seems all the Crime this brave Fellow has committed, is serving
his Country without Authority.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
’Tis so, and however I admire the Man, I&nbsp;am resolv’d to be of the
contrary Party, that I may make an Interest in our new Governor. Thus

<p><span class = "speaker">Haz.</span>
But my Kinsman’s Character&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
He was a <i>Leicestershire</i> younger Brother, came over with a small
Fortune, which his Industry has increas’d to a thousand Pounds a year;
and he is now Colonel <i>John Surelove</i>, and one of the Council.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Haz.</span>

Come, Mr. <i>Dunce</i>, though you are no Counsellor, yet your Counsel
may be good in time of Necessity, as now.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Dun.</span>
If I may <a class = "notes" name = "widow_texttag25" id =
"widow_texttag25" href = "#widow_textnote25">give</a> worthy Advice,
I&nbsp;do not look upon our Danger to be so great from the
<i>Indians</i>, as from young <i>Bacon</i>, whom the People have
nick-nam’d <i>Fright-all</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Whim.</span>
Ay, ay, that same <i>Bacon</i>, I&nbsp;would he were well hang’d:
I&nbsp;am afraid that under pretence of killing all the <i>Indians</i>
he means to murder us, lie with our Wives, and hang up our little
Children, and make himself Lord and King.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Whiff.</span>
Brother <i>Whimsey</i>, not so hot; with leave of the honourable Board,
my Wife is of opinion, that <i>Bacon</i> came seasonably to our Aid, and
what he has done was for our Defence, the <i>Indians</i> came down upon
us, and ravish’d us all, Men, Women, and Children.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">236</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Well.</span>
If these Grievances were not redrest, we had our Reasons for it; it was
not that we were insensible, Captain <i>Whiff</i>, of what we suffer’d
from the Insolence of the <i>Indians</i>; but all knew what we must
expect from <i>Bacon</i>, if that by lawful Authority he had arrived to
so great a Command as General; nor would we be hufft out of our
Commissions.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Down.</span>
’Tis most certain that <i>Bacon</i> did not demand a Commission out of a
design of serving us, but to satisfy his Ambition and his Love; it being
no secret that he passionately admires the <i>Indian</i> Queen, and
under the pretext of a War, intends to kill the King her Husband,
establish himself in her Heart, and on all occasions <a class = "notes"
name = "widow_texttag26" id = "widow_texttag26" href =
"#widow_textnote26">make</a> himself a more formidable Enemy than the
Indians are.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Whim.</span>
Nay, nay, I ever foresaw he would prove a Villain.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Whiff.</span>
Nay, and he be thereabout, my <i>Nancy</i> shall have no more to do with
him.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Well.</span>
But, Gentlemen, the People daily flock to him, so that his Army is too
considerable for us to oppose by any thing but Policy.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Down.</span>
We are sensible, Gentlemen, that our Fortunes, our Honours, and our
Lives are at stake; and therefore you are call’d together to consult
what’s to be done in this Grand Affair, till our Governour and Forces
arrive from <i>England</i>: the Truce he made with the <i>Indians</i>
will be out to morrow.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Whiff.</span>
Ay, and then he intends to have another bout with the <i>Indians</i>.
Let’s have patience, I&nbsp;say, till he has thrumb’d their Jackets, and
then to work with your Politicks as soon as you please.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Down.</span>
Colonel <i>Wellman</i> has answer’d that point, good Captain
<i>Whiff</i>; ’tis the Event of this Battel we ought to dread; and if
won or lost, will be equally fatal for us, either from the
<i>Indians</i> or from <i>Bacon</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Dun.</span>
With the Permission of the honourable Board, I&nbsp;think I have hit
upon an Expedient that may prevent this Battel: your Honours shall write
a Letter to <i>Bacon</i>,
<span class = "pagenum">237</span>
where you shall acknowledge his Services, invite him kindly home, and
offer him a Commission for General&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Whiff.</span>
Just my <i>Nancy’s</i> Counsel&mdash;Dr. <i>Dunce</i> has spoken like a
Cherubin, he shall have my Voice for General; what say you, Brother
<i>Whimsey</i>?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker"><a class = "notes" name = "widow_texttag27"
id = "widow_texttag27" href = "#widow_textnote27">Down.</a></span>
I say he is a Noble Fellow, and fit for a General.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Dun.</span>
But conceive me right, Gentlemen; as soon as he shall have render’d
himself, seize him, and strike off his Head at the Fort.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Whiff.</span>
Hum! his Head&mdash;Brother.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Whim.</span>
Ay, ay, Dr. <i>Dunce</i> speaks like a Cherubin.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Well.</span>
Mr. <i>Dunce</i>, your Counsel in extremity, I&nbsp;confess, is not
amiss; but I should be loth to deal dishonourably with any Man.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Down.</span>
His Crimes deserve Death, his Life is forfeited by Law, but shall never
be taken by my consent by Treachery: If by any Stratagem we could take
him alive, and either send him for <i>England</i> to receive there his
Punishment, or keep him Prisoner here till the Governour arrive,
I&nbsp;should agree to it; but I question his coming in upon our
Invitation.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Dun.</span>
Leave that to me.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Whim.</span>
Come, I’ll warrant him, the Rogue’s as stout as <i>Hector</i>, he fears
neither Heaven nor Hell.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Down.</span>
He’s too brave and bold to refuse our Summons, and I am for sending him
for <i>England</i>, and leaving him to the King’s Mercy.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Dun.</span>
In that you’ll find more difficulty, Sir; to take him off here will be
more quick and sudden: for the People worship him.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Well.</span>
I’ll never yield to so ungenerous an Expedient. The seizing him I am
content in the Extremity wherein we are to follow. What say you, Colonel
<i>Downright</i>? shall we send him a Letter now, while this two days
Truce lasts, between him and the <i>Indians</i>?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Down.</span>

of my own to prevail with him.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Whim.</span>
Why, Brother <i>Whiff</i>, you were for making him a General but

<p><span class = "speaker">Dun.</span>
Your Honours are in the right; and whatever those two leading

the punctilio of Honour is such a thing.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
Mrs. <i>Chrisante</i>, I heard your Father would not be here to day,
which made me snatch this opportunity of seeing you.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ran.</span>
Come, come, a Pox of this whining Love, it spoils good Company.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
You know, my dear Friend, these Opportunities come but seldom, and
therefore I must make use of them.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Ran.</span>
Come, come, I’ll give you a better Opportunity at my House to morrow, we
are to eat a Buffalo there, and I’ll secure the old Gentleman from
coming.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
Then I shall see <i>Chrisante</i> once more before I go.</p>

But will he come when sent for?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
If he refuse we are to endeavour to force him.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Chris.</span>
I do not think he will be forc’d, not even by <i>Friendly</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
And, faith, it goes against my Conscience to lift my Sword against him,
for he is truly brave, and what he has done, a&nbsp;Service to the
Country, had it but been by Authority.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Chris.</span>
What pity ’tis there should be such false Maxims in the World, that
noble Actions, however great, must be criminal for want of a Law to
authorise ’em.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Friend.</span>
Indeed ’tis pity that when Laws are faulty they should not be mended or
abolish’d.</p>

Hark ye, <i>Charles</i>, by Heaven, if you kill my <i>Daring</i> I’ll
pistol you.</p>

No, Widow, I’ll spare him for your sake.

War, Sir, is not my Business nor my Pleasure: Nor was I bred in Arms, my

yet whilst I may&mdash;whilst this Cessation lasts, I&nbsp;beg we may

<p><span class = "speaker">King.</span>
For your part, Sir, you’ve been so noble, that I repent the fatal
Difference that makes us meet in Arms. Yet though I’m young, I’m
sensible of Injuries; and oft have heard my Grandsire say, That we were
Monarchs once of all this spacious World, till you, an unknown People,
landing here, distress’d and ruin’d by destructive Storms, abusing all
our charitable Hospitality, usurp’d our Right, and made your Friends
your Slaves.</p>

<i>trusting for old Oliver’s Funeral broke.</i> The obsequies of Oliver
Cromwell, originally fixed for 9 November, 1658, owing to the
extraordinary magnificence of the preparations were not performed until
23 November. For many days his waxen effigy, dressed in robes of state,
was exhibited at Somerset House. The expenses totalled £60,000, and it
was a public scandal that a great part of this wanton and wasteful
extravagance remained unpaid, to the undoing of the undertakers. On 25
August, 1659, in the <i>Kalendar of State Affairs (Domestic)</i>, the
following occurs: ‘Report by the Committee appointed by Parliament to
examine what is due for mourning for the late General Cromwell, that on
perusal of the bills signed by Cromwell’s servants, and of the account
of Abr. Barrington, his auditor, it appears that £19,303 0<i>s.</i>
11<i>d.</i> is still due and unpaid for mourning. Also that Nath.
Waterhouse, servant to Rich. Cromwell, should be authorized to see the
persons in a list [missing] annexed for that mourning. Col. Rich to make
this report. Schedule of debts due to 11 mercers and drapers for the
funeral of the late General Cromwell. Total £19,303 0<i>s.</i>

<i>Agah Yerkin.</i> The various dictionaries and vocabularies of the
Indian languages I have had resource to give none of these words. There
is, however, so great a confusion of Indian jargons and dialects that
they cannot be pronounced fictitious. Yet Mrs. Behn would hardly, even
if she had learned the language, have retained any exact knowledge of
such barbaric tongues, and one may almost certainly say that these cries
and incantations are her own composition. Amongst other authorities I
have consulted <i>The Voyage of Robert Dudley ... to the West
Indies</i>, 1594-5, edited by G.&nbsp;F. Warner for the Hakluyt Society
(1889). Dr. Brinton’s <i>Arawack Language of Guiana</i>, an exhaustive

<i>Quiocto.</i> Mrs. Behn probably meant to spell this word
‘Quiyoughcto’, the sound being identical. There is in Virginia a river
which in the seventeenth century was called the ‘Quiyough’. The
inhabitants of the banks of this river had mysterious or supernatural
properties ascribed to them. <i>In the Voyages &amp; Discoveries of
Capt. John Smith</i> (1606), we have: ‘They thinke that their Werowanees
and Priests, which they also esteeme Quiyoughcosughes, when they are
dead, doe goe beyond the mountaines towards the setting of the sun.’ No
doubt Mrs. Behn knew this passage. I&nbsp;owe the above interesting note

<i>Flambeaux.</i> Mrs. Behn (or, haply, George Jenkins, the first editor

writes ‘a Flambeaux’. In addition to the example from Herbert which I
give in my note (Vol. III, p.&nbsp;475), I&nbsp;find a plural
‘Flambeaux’s’ used by Mrs. Manley. cf. <i>Secret Memoirs &amp; Manners

the same as the Prologue to <i>Abdelazer</i>. In line 32 we have
‘Basset’ in place of the obsolescent game, ‘Beasts’ (damn’d Beasts).
Basset, which resembled Faro, was first played at Venice. cf. Evelyn’s

San Felice, to see the noblemen and their ladies at basset, a&nbsp;game
at cards which is much used.’ It became immensely popular in England.
Evelyn, in his famous description of ‘the inexpressible luxury and
profaneness, gaming, and all dissoluteness’ on the Sunday se’nnight
before the death of Charles II, specially noted that ‘about twenty of
the great courtiers and other dissolute persons were at Basset round a
large table, a&nbsp;bank of at least 2000 in gold before them.’

<p><span class = "firstword">Mirtilla</span>, the Amorous Jilt, who had
once been attached to George Marteen, the Younger Brother, married for a
convenience the clownish Sir Morgan Blunder. Prince Frederick, who had
seen and fallen in love with her during a religious ceremony in a Ghent
convent, follows her to England. They meet accidentally and she promises
him a private interview. George Marteen had recommended a page to
Mirtilla, and the lad is his sister Olivia in disguise. Mirtilla,
although she falls in love with her ‘smooth-chin’d boy’, receives Prince
Frederick, but the house wherein she lodges catches fire that night, and
it is George Marteen who, in spite of the fact that he knows his friend
the Prince is with her, procures a ladder and rescues the lady at some
danger to himself. The Prince is able to escape by the same way, and he
then carries Mirtilla to his own lodgings, where feigning to be ill with
fatigue and terror she begs her lover to leave her to repose. This is
done with the idea of entertaining her page, and on Frederick’s approach
she conceals Olivia, who thus creeps off unseen, beneath the train of
her gown, whilst she herself retires with the amorous Prince. None the
less, Mirtilla still pursues Olivia, and eventually Frederick discovers
she is a wanton jilt, as he surprises her leading the page to her bed.
He is, however, reconciled when Mirtilla discovering to her amaze that
the lad is a woman reveals this fact to the Prince to confound him, but
afterwards avowing her frailty, throws herself on Frederick’s
generosity. Olivia has been promised by her old father, Sir Rowland
Marteen, to Welborn, whom she has never seen. On meeting Welborn she
falls in love with him, without knowing who he is, and he, also, whilst
ignorant of her name, is soon enamoured of her in turn. Prince Frederick
lodges in the same house as Welborn and it is hither that after the fire
she attends Mirtilla. Welborn, supposing her to be Mirtilla’s page, out
of kindness offers her half his bed, which for fear of arousing
suspicion she is bound to accept. She slips away, however, before
daybreak, leaving a letter for her companion, by which he learns that
the page is none other than the lady whom he had seen in the Mall.
Welborn and Olivia are eventually married. George Marteen’s elder
brother, Sir Merlin, a&nbsp;boon companion of Sir Morgan Blunder, is a
rakehelly dog, who leads a wild town life to the great anger of old Sir
Rowland. George, who whilst secretly leading a gay life under the name
of Lejere, appears before his father as a demure and sober young
prentice, is designed for Lady Youthly, an ancient, toothless crone,
palsied and blind with extreme old age, whose grand-daughter, Teresia,
is to be married to Sir Rowland himself. George, however, falls in love
with Teresia, who is also pursued by Sir Merlin, and finally weds her in
despite of his father, brother and the beldame. But Sir Rowland shortly
relents and even forgives his eldest son, who has married Diana, the
cast off mistress of a gambler, whilst Lady Youthly is left to the
tender consolations of her chaplain.</p>

<p><i>The Younger Brother; or, The Amorous Jilt</i> was written (in
great part at least) by Mrs. Behn a good many years before her death,
after which it was brought on the stage under the auspices of Gildon, in
1696; and in the Epistle Dedicatory he expressly says ‘all the
Alterations which I made were in the first Act, in removing that old
bustle about <i>Whigg</i> and <i>Tory</i> (which was the subject of most
of the Second Scene) and placing the Character of a <i>Rake-hell</i> in
its room.’ Mrs. Behn probably wrote the first Act sometime about the
years 1681-3, when there was a continual ‘rout with Whigging and with
Torying’, and afterwards completed the remainder at her leisure. In his
notice of this comedy Langbaine’s editor (Gildon), who finds Mirtilla
‘genteel’, says that Astrea took a portion of the plot ‘from a true
story of the brother of Col. Henry Martin, and a Lady that must be
nameless. See the Novel call’d <i>Hatige</i>.’ <i>Hattige: or, the
Amours of the King of Tamaran. A&nbsp;Novel</i>, by Gabriel de Brémond,
was translated in 1680. (12mo. For Simon the African: Amsterdam, [R.
Bentley? London.]) A&nbsp;biting satire on Charles II and Lady
Castlemaine, the tale is told with considerable spirit and attained
great vogue. Another edition was issued in 1683, and under the title
<i>The Beautiful Turk</i> it is to be found in <i>A&nbsp;Select
Collection of Novels</i> (1720 and 1729), Vol. III. This novel had first
appeared anonymously at Cologne in 1676&mdash;<i>Hattigé ou la Belle
Turque, qui contient ses amours avec le roi Tamaran</i>&mdash;and Nodier
in his <i>Mélanges d’une petite Bibliothèque</i> describes a ‘clef’.
Hattigé is, of course, Lady Castlemaine; Tamaran, Charles II; and the
handsome Rajeb with whom the lady deceives the monarch, Jack Churchill.
It is a wanton little book, and at the time must have been irresistibly
piquant. Beyond the likeness between the characters of Mirtilla and
Hattigé the novel has, however, little in common with Mrs. Behn’s play.
Gildon’s comment is, of course, founded upon the passage in
<i>Oroonoko</i> which says: ‘We met on the river with Colonel Martin,
a&nbsp;man of great gallantry, wit and goodness, and whom I have
celebrated in a character of my new comedy by his own name in memory of
so brave a man.’</p>

<p>In D’Urfey’s <i>The Royalist</i>, an excellent comedy produced at
Dorset Garden, 1682 (4to, 1682), the author introduces a certain damsel
Philippa, who, disguised as a page, follows the loyal Sir Charles
Kinglove with whom she is enamoured. At the end of the second Act her
boy’s clothes involve her in the same predicament as befalls Olivia in
Act iv of <i>The Younger Brother</i>. Although Genest prefers Mrs.
Behn’s treatment of the situation, it must, I&nbsp;think, be allowed
that D’Urfey has managed the jest with far greater verve and spirit.
Honest Tom D’Urfey is in fact one of the least read and most maligned of
all our dramatists. He had the merriest comic gifts, and perhaps when
the critics and literary historians deign to read his plays he will
attain a higher position in our theatrical libraries.</p>

<p>Some critics have suggested that D’Urfey, in his <i>The Intrigues at
Versailles</i>, produced at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, 1697, may have taken a
hint
<span class = "pagenum">315</span>
from Mrs. Behn’s Mirtilla, and Wycherley’s Olivia (<i>The Plain
Dealer</i>) for his ‘Madame de Vandosme a right jilt in all humours’,
a&nbsp;rôle created by Mrs. Barry. There is indeed some resemblance
between all these three characters, base heartless coquettes; and
D’Urfey, in making his jilt prefer Sir Blunder Bosse, ‘a dull sordid
brute and mongrel, whose humour is to call everybody by clownish names’,
to all her other gallants, seems not to have forgotten Mirtilla’s
marriage with Sir Morgan Blunder. The very names call attention to the
plagiarism. <i>The Intrigues at Versailles</i> is none the less a clever
and witty comedy, but a little overcrowded with incident and
business.</p>

<p>As sufficiently explained by Gildon, under whose auspices this
posthumous play was produced at Drury Lane in 1696, <i>The Younger
Brother; or, The Amorous Jilt</i> met with brutal treatment from the
audience. There appears to have been a faction, particularly in evidence
at its first performance and on the third day, who were steadfastly
resolved to damn the comedy, and in spite of fine acting and every
advantage it was hissed from the boards. Gildon attributes the failure
to ‘the tedious Scenes in Blank Verse betwixt Mirtilla and Prince
Frederick’ which he thinks demanded ‘another more easy Dress,’ but, in
truth, it can only be attributed to the most verjuiced spite and
personal malice. The plot, though somewhat complicated with perhaps a
press of crowding incidents, is none the less highly interesting, and
the characters are most of them excellently, all well, drawn and
sustained. The fact that certain episodes had to be cut in
representation in order to bring the comedy within a reasonable time
limit, though it may have tended to obscure the connection of the
intrigue, could not have insured in spite of its many real merits so
absolute a doom for the much maltreated play, a&nbsp;sentence which
seems to have wantonly precluded any revival.</p>

who are so Eminent for that Vertue, which more than all the rest,
commands the Esteem and Veneration of the Thinking World, your
Generosity I mean, Sir, which gives the most Perfect Touches of that

whilst we lost our real Good, will still naturally flow from those
Springs of Pleasure, Honour, Glory, and Noble Actions, the Passions
given us by Heaven for our common Good. But their own Practice generally
shew’d the Vanity of their Emperic Boasts, when they Buried all the

Vanity has always been the Refuge of little Souls, that place their

<span class = "pagenum">317</span>
Avaritious, Designing Saint; Titles do for the proud Avarice of the meer

Generous man only that fixes himself in the Hearts of the most valuable
part of mankind, when proper Merit only is esteem’d, and the Man, not

<p>The Application of this, I shall leave to all that know you, Sir, who
are all sensible what Virtues you make your Darlings, and choice of
Virtue shews the Nobleness of our Temper, as much as Choice of Friends,
the degrees of our Understandings; and if that be true that most Men
choose those Virtues which are nearest a-kin to their Darling Vices, I’m
sure ’twill be a strong proof, that ev’n your Failings (for ev’ry Man
has his share of them too) are more Beneficial to the world than the
Vertues of a numerous part of Mankind. In Collonel <i>Codrington</i>
indeed, we find the true Spirit and Bravery of old <i>Rome</i>, that
despises all dangers, that in the Race of Glory thou art the Noble
Chace. Nor can the manly Roughness of your Martial Temper (Fierce to
none but your Countries Foes) destroy that ingaging sweetness your
agreeable Conversation abounds with, which heightened with so large a
share of Wit, Learning, and Judgment, improves as well as delights; so
that to have known you any way, must give us some advantage or other.
This it was that encourag’d me to dedicate this Play, Sir, to you, of
which I may venture to say more, and with more assurance, than if it had
been my own.</p>

<p>Mrs. BEHN was a Woman so Accomplish’d, and of so Established a Fame
among the Men of Sense, that I cou’d not suppose a very severe treatment
from the Town, which has been very indulgent to the Performances of
others; especially when, besides the Reputation of the <i>Author</i>,
the Play itself had an Intrinsic Merit; for we find it full of Humour,
Wit, and Variety; the Conversation Gay and Genteel, the Love Soft and
Pathetic, the incidents Natural, and Easy, and the Conduct of the Plot
very Justifiable. So that I may reasonably impute its miscarriage to
some Faction that was made against it, which indeed was very Evident on
the First day, and more on the endeavours employed, to render the
Profits of the Third, as small as could be.</p>

<p>It suffer’d not, I’m sure, in the Action, nor in <a class = "comm"
name = "brother_commtag2" id = "brother_commtag2" href =
"#brother_commnote2">Mr. <i>Verbruggen’s</i> reading of some of his
Part</a>, since he lost nothing of the Force of Elocution, nor
Gracefulness of Action; nor indeed can I, with Justice to my self,
impute it to any part that I ventur’d to add to the Original; for all
the Alterations which I made were in the first Act, in removing that old
bustle about <i>Whigg</i> and <i>Tory</i>, (which was the Subject of
most of the Second Scene) and placing the Character of a
<i>Rake-hell</i> in its room, which was so little, that it could not
Influence a more Capricious Audience, to the
<span class = "pagenum">318</span>
Damning of the whole. There might indeed be some objections about the
Plot, but not very Rational, I&nbsp;think; I’m sure, at least, ’tis the
first Play, for some Years, could be quarrell’d at for having too much
Plot. In the Edition however I have put in a great deal, which the
length of the Play oblig’d me to cut out for the Action.</p>

<p>Here, Sir, if the Play had been my own, I&nbsp;should have complain’d
that the Town had its favourite Fools, as well as favourite Wits, and
that Comedy or Farce from any other hand wou’d no more go down with
them, than their favourites will with true Judges that read, not see
’em. I&nbsp;should have had indignation enough, perhaps, to’ve rail’d at
the Criticks of all Degrees, and Denominations of Box and Pit, nay,
Galleries too, and told ’em that they were so conceited of their own
Wit, that they cou’d take no pleasure in hearing that of another, or
that Wit in a Play seeming to affront the Parts of the Audience, they
suffer’d their Resentment to destroy their Satisfaction. This, and a
great many other Satyrical Reflections, which are natural for a
Disappointed Poet to make, I&nbsp;shou’d then have vented; but being
satisfy’d, that the Reputation of Mrs. BEHN is not affected by the
malicious Endeavours of some of my Enemies, I&nbsp;now present it under
your Patronage, Sir, to the more competent Judges; Proud of the
Opportunity of Offering you an occasion of so agreeable a Province, as
the Protection of the unfortunate, and letting the World know how much I

<em>Britton</em>.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
Were you with Mrs. <i>Manage</i>, <i>Britton</i>?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Britt.</span>
Yes, Sir; and she cries as much for her wanting room for you in her
House, as she would have done some forty Years ago for a Disappointment
of her Lover. But she assures me, the Lodging she has taken for you, is
the best in all <i>Lincolns-Inn-Fields</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
And did you charge her to send <i>Mirtilla’s</i> Page to me?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Britt.</span>
I did, Sir; and he’ll be with you instantly.</p>

<i>Britton</i>, haste thee, and get my Equipage in order;
a&nbsp;handsome Coach, rich Liveries, and more Footmen: for ’tis
Appearance only passes in the World&mdash;And d’ye hear, take care none
know me by any other Name than that of <i>Lejere</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Britt.</span>
I shall, Sir.
<span class = "stagedir">
Exit.</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
I came not from <i>Paris</i> into <i>England</i>, as my old Father
thinks, to reform into a dull wretched Life in <i>Wales.</i> No, I’ll
rather trust my kind Mistress Fortune, that has still kept me like her
Darling, than purchase a younger Brother’s narrow Stipend, at the
expence of my Pleasure and Happiness.</p>

<p class = "entrance">
Enter <em>Olivia</em> in a Page’s Habit. She runs and embraces
<em>George</em>.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
My ever charming Brother!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
My best, my dear <i>Olivia</i>!</p>

<span class = "pagenum">323</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
The same lovely Man still! Thy Gallantry and Beauty’s all thy own;
<i>Paris</i> could add no Graces to thy Air; nor yet pervert it into
Affectation.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
Spare me, and tell me how <i>Mirtilla</i> fares.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
I think, Brother, I writ you word to Paris, of a Marriage concluded
betwixt me and <i>Welborn</i>?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
That Letter I receiv’d: but from the dear <i>Mirtilla</i>, not one soft
word; not one tender Line has blest my Eyes, has eas’d my panting Heart
this tedious three Months space; and thou with whom I left the weighty
Charge of her dear Heart, to watch her lovely Eyes, to give me notice
when my Rivals press’d, and when she waver’d in her Faith to me, even
thou wert silent to me, cruel Sister.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
Thou wilt be like a Lover presently, and tire the Hearer with a Book of
Words, of heavy Sighs, dying Languishments, and all that huddle of
Nonsense; and not tell me how you like my Marriage.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
<i>Welborn’s</i> my Friend, and worthy of thy Heart.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
I never saw him yet; and to be sold unseen, and unsigh’d for, in the
Flower of my Youth and Beauty, gives me a strange aversion to the
Match.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
Oh! you’ll like him when you see him&mdash;But my
<i>Mirtilla</i>.&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
Like him&mdash;no, no, I never shall&mdash;what, come a Stranger to my
Husband’s Bed? ’Tis Prostitution in the leudest manner, without the
Satisfaction; the Pleasure of Variety, and the Bait of Profit, may make
a lame excuse for Whores, who change their Cullies, and quit their
nauseous Fools&mdash;No, no, my Brother, when Parents grow arbitrary,
’tis time we look into our Rights and Privileges; therefore, my dear
<i>George</i>, if e’er thou hope for Happiness in Love, assist my
Disobedience.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
In any worthy Choice be sure of me; but canst thou wish Happiness in
Love, and not inform me something of <i>Mirtilla</i>?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">324</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
I’ll tell you better News&mdash;our hopeful elder Brother, Sir
<i>Merlin</i>, is like to be disinherited; for he is, Heaven be
thanked&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
Marry’d to some Town-Jilt, the common fate of Coxcombs.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
Not so, my dear <i>George</i>, but sets up for a celebrated Rake-hell,
as well as Gamester; he cou’d not have found out a more dextrous way to
have made thee Heir to four Thousand Pounds a Year.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
What’s that without <i>Mirtilla</i>?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
Prithee no more of her&mdash;Love spoils a fine Gentleman: Gaming,
Whoring and Fighting may qualify a Man for Conversation; but Love
perverts all one’s Thoughts, and makes us fit Company for none but one’s
self; for even a Mistress can scarce dispense with a <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘fighing’">fighting</ins>, whining
Lover’s Company long, though all he says flatters her Pride.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
Why dost thou trifle with me, when thou knowest the Violence of my
Love?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
I wish I could any way divert your Thoughts from her, I&nbsp;would not
have your Joy depend on such a fickle Creature.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
<i>Mirtilla</i> false! What, my <i>Mirtilla</i> false!</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
Even your <i>Mirtilla’s</i> false, and married to another.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
Married! <i>Mirtilla</i> married! ’Tis impossible.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
Nay, married to that bawling, drinking Fool, Sir <i>Morgan
Blunder</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
Married, and married to Sir <i>Morgan Blunder</i>! a&nbsp;Sot, an
ill-bred senseless Fool; almost too great a Fool to make a Country
Justice?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
No doubt, she had her Aims in’t, he’s a very convenient Husband, I’ll
assure you, and that suits her Temper: he has Estate and Folly enough,
and she has Youth and Wantonness enough to match ’em.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
Her Choice gives me some Comfort, and some Hopes; for I’ll pursue her,
but for Revenge, not Love.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">325</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
Forget her rather, for she’s not worth Revenge, and that way ’twill be
none; prostitute in Soul as Body, she doats even on me in Breeches.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
On thee, her Page? doat on thee, a&nbsp;Youth! she knew thee not as
Woman.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
No, that Secret I have kept to do you Service.&mdash;At first she said
she lov’d me for your sake, because you recommended me; and when I sung,
or plaid upon my Flute, wou’d kiss my Cheek, and sigh, and often (when
alone) wou’d send for me, and smile, and talk, and set my Hair in Curls,
to make me saucy and familiar with her. One Day she said,
<i>Endimion</i>, thy Name-sake was thus caress’d by <i>Cynthia</i>:
A&nbsp;Goddess did not scorn the humble Swain, whom by her Love she
equal’d to her Deity. She found that I had Sense to understand her, and
paid her Advances back with equal Ardour.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
Oh, Curse! where learnt she all this Wickedness?
<span class = "stagedir">
Aside.</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
But she being oblig’d to go for <i>Flanders</i>, to see her Sister take
the holy Habit, I&nbsp;feign’d a Sickness to be left behind, hoping that
Absence might abate her Flame; yet she return’d more amorous, and
fearing the Thefts of Love might wound her Honour, she thought a Husband
would secure that Shame; and luckily my Aunt arriv’d from <i>Wales</i>,
and brought Sir <i>Morgan</i> with her, who lodging where we did, at
Mrs. <i>Manage’s</i>, my Aunt (that doats on Quality in either Sex) made
up this hasty Match, unknown to me, though for my sake.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
What will not faithless Woman do, when she is raging?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
And now having so well prepar’d the way, she grows impatient for an
Opportunity; and thou art arriv’d, most happily to succour me.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
No, for some days keep this habit on, it may be useful to us; but I must
see this faithless perjur’d Woman, which I must contrive with Mrs.
<i>Manage</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">326</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
Yet pray resolve to see my Father first; for now’s the critical time to
make thy Fortune: he came to Town last night, and lodges here at Mrs.
<i>Manage’s</i>, with my Aunt <i>Blunder</i>.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
What, in the House with thee, and not know thee?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
No more than a Priest Compassion; he thinks me at <i>Hackney</i>,
<a class = "comm" name = "brother_commtag4" id = "brother_commtag4" href =
"#brother_commnote4">making Wax Babies</a>, where he intends to visit me
within these three days,&mdash;But I forgot to tell you, our Brother,
Sir <i>Merlin</i>, lodges in this House with you; and shou’d he know
you&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
’Tis impossible&mdash;I’ve not see him, or my Father, these five Years.
Absence, my Growth, and this unexpected Equipage, will not be penetrated
by his Capacity.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
True, he’ll never look for his Brother <i>George</i>, in the Gallantry
and Person of Monsieur <i>Lejere</i>&mdash;My good Father expects you
home, like the prodigal Son, all torn and tatter’d, and as penitent
too.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
To plod on here, in a laborious Cheating, all my Youth and Vigour, in
hopes of drunken Pleasures when I’m old; or else go with him into
<i>Wales</i>, and there lead a thoughtless Life, hunt, and drink, and
make love to none but Chamber-maids. No, my <i>Olivia</i>, I’ll use the
sprightly Runnings of my Life, and not hope distant Pleasures from its
Dregs.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Oliv.</span>
For that, use your Discretion; now equip your self to your present
Business; the more simply you are clad and look, the better. I’ll home
and expect you.
<span class = "stagedir">
Exit.</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
Do so, my good Sister; a little formal Hypocrisy may do, ’twill relish
after Liberty; for a Pleasure is never so well tasted, as when it’s
season’d with some Opposition.</p>

<p class = "entrance">

Then they are fit for me; my Mistress, Sir, that Treasure of my Life,
for whom you’ve heard me sigh, is perjur’d, false, and married to
another. Yet what is worse, I&nbsp;find my Prince, my Friend, here in my
native Country, and am not able to pay him what his Greatness
merits.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Prince.</span>
Thou canst say nothing I can value less.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
Perhaps too my way of Living has deceiv’d you, being still receiv’d by
Princes, as Companions in all their Riots, Loves, and Divertisements;
where ev’n you did me the Honour to esteem, and call me Friend.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Prince.</span>
Whate’er thou art, I’m sure thy Mind’s illustrious.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
My Family, I must confess, is honourable; but, Sir, my Father was the
younger House, of which my unhappy self was destin’d to be last: I’m a
<i>Cadet</i>, that Out-cast of my Family, and born to that curse of our
old <i>English</i> Custom. Whereas in other Countries, younger Brothers
are train’d up to the Exercise of Arms, where
<span class = "pagenum">328</span>
Honour and Renown attend the Brave; we basely bind our youngest out to
Slavery, to lazy Trades, idly confin’d to Shops or Merchants Books,
debasing of the Spirit to the mean Cunning, how to cheat and
chaffer.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Prince.</span>
A Custom insupportable!&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
To this, to this low wretchedness of Life, your Servant, Sir&mdash;was
destin’d by his Parents, and am yet this bound indentur’d Slave.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Prince.</span>
Thou hast no cause to quarrel with thy Stars, since Virtue is most
valu’d when opprest&mdash;Are all your Merchants Apprentices thus
gay?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
Not all&mdash;but, Sir, I could not bow my Mind to this so necessary
Drudgery; and yet however, I&nbsp;assum’d my native Temper, when out
o’th’ Trading City; in it, I&nbsp;forc’d my Nature to a dull slovenly
Gravity, which well enough deceiv’d the busy Block-heads; my Clothes and
Equipage I lodg’d at this End of the Town, where I still pass’d for
something better than I was, whene’er I pleas’d to change the Trader for
the Gentleman.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Prince.</span>
And liv’d thus undiscover’d&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
With Ease, still lov’d and courted by the Great, ever play’d high with
those durst venture most; and durst make Love where’er my Fancy lik’d:
but sometimes running out my Master’s Cash, (which was supply’d still by
my Father) they sent me, to reform my expensive Life, a&nbsp;Factor,
into <i>France</i>&mdash;still I essay’d to be a plodding Thriver, but
found my Parts not form’d for dirty Business.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Prince.</span>
There’s not a Thought, an Action of thy Soul, that does not tend to
something far more glorious.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
If yet you think me worthy of your Favour, command that Life you have so
oft preserv’d.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Prince.</span>
No more;&mdash;Thou hast increas’d my Value for thee.&mdash;Oh! take my
Heart, and see how’t has been us’d by a fair Charmer, since I saw thee
last&mdash;That sullen day we parted, you for <i>England</i>, you may
remember I design’d for <i>Flanders</i>.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">329</span>
<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
I do, with Melancholy, Sir, remember it.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Prince.</span>
Arriv’d at <i>Ghent</i>, I&nbsp;went to see an <i>English</i> Nun
initiated, where I beheld the pretty Innocent, deliver’d up a Victim to
foolish Chastity; but among the Relations, then attending the Sacrifice,
was a fair Sister of the young Votress, but so surpassing all I’ad seen
before, that I neglecting the dull holy Business, paid my Devotion to
that kneeling Saint.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
That was the nearest way to Heaven, my Lord.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Prince.</span>
Her Face, that had a thousand Charms of Youth, was heighten’d with an
Air of Languishment; a&nbsp;lovely Sorrow dwelt upon her Eyes, that
taught my new-born-Passion Awe and Reverence.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Geo.</span>
This Description of her fires me.&mdash;
<span class = "stagedir">
Aside.</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Prince.</span>
Her dimpl’d Mouth, her Neck, her Hand, her Hair, a&nbsp;Majesty and
Grace in every Motion, compleated my Undoing; I&nbsp;rav’d,
I&nbsp;burnt, I&nbsp;languish’d with Desire, the holy Place cou’d scarce
contain my Madness: with Pain, with Torture, I&nbsp;restrain’d my
Passion when she retir’d, led sadly from the Altar. I, mixing with the
Croud, enquir’d her Name and Country; her Servant told me, that she was
of Quality, and liv’d in <i>England</i>, nay, in this very Town: this
gave me Anguish not to be conceiv’d, till I resolv’d to follow her,
which is the cause you find me here so soon. Thy Aid, thy Aid,

The <i>Town-Rake</i>; written by <a class = "comm" name =

<h5>I.</h5>

<div class = "song">
<p>What Life can compare with the jolly Town-Rake’s,</p>
<p>When in Youth his full Swing of all Pleasure he takes?</p>
<p>At Noon, he gets up, for a Whet, and to dine,</p>
<p>And wings the dull Hours with Mirth, Musick and Wine;</p>
<p>Then jogs to the <em>Play-house</em>, and chats with the Masks,</p>
<p>And thence to <a class = "comm" name = "brother_commtag7" id =
"brother_commtag7" href = "#brother_commnote7">the <em>Rose</em></a>,
where he takes his three Flasks.</p>
<p>There, great as a <em>Cæsar</em>, he revels, when drunk,</p>
<p>And <a class = "comm" name = "brother_commtag8" id =
"brother_commtag8" href = "#brother_commnote8">scours</a> all he meets,
as he reels to his Punk;</p>
<p>Then finds the dear Girl in his Arms when he wakes.</p>
<p>What Life can compare with the Jolly Town-Rake’s?</p>
</div>

<h5>II.</h5>

<div class = "song">
<p>He, like the <em>Great Turk</em>, has his Favourite She;</p>
<p>But the Town’s his <em>Seraglio</em>, and still he lives free.</p>
<p>Sometimes she’s a Lady; but as he must range,</p>
<p><em>Black-Betty</em>, or <em>Oyster-Doll</em>, serves for a
Change.</p>
<p>As he varies his Sports, his whole Life is a Feast;</p>
<p>He thinks him that’s soberest the most like a Beast.</p>
<p>At Houses of Pleasure breaks Windows and Doors;</p>
<p>Kicks Bullies and Cullies, then lies with their Whores.</p>
<p>Rare work for the Surgeon, and Midwife he makes.</p>
<p>What Life can compare with the Jolly Town-Rake’s?</p>
</div>

<h5>III.</h5>

<div class = "song">
<p>Thus in <em>Covent-Garden</em> he makes his Campaign,</p>
<p>And no Coffee-house haunts, but to settle his Brain.</p>
<p>He laughs at dry Morals, and never does think,</p>
<p>Unless ’tis to get the best Wenches and Drink.</p>
<p>He dwells in a Tavern, and lies ev’ry where,</p>
<p>And improving his hours, lives an Age in a Tear:</p>
<span class = "pagenum">332</span>
<p>For as Life is uncertain, he loves to make haste;</p>
<p>And thus he lives longest, because he lives fast:</p>
<p>Then a Leap in the dark to the Devil he takes.</p>
<p>What Death can compare with the Jolly Town-Rake’s?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
Why, how now, Sir <i>Morgan</i>, I&nbsp;see you’ll make a Husband of the
right Town-Mode: What, married but four Days, and at your separate
Apartment already?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Morg.</span>
A Plague of your what d’ye call ums.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
Rakehells you would say, Cousin, an honourable Appellation for Men of
Bravery.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Morg.</span>
Ay, ay, your Rakehells&mdash;I&nbsp;was never so muddled with Treason,
Tierce Claret, Oaths and Dice, all the Days of my Life&mdash;Was I in
case to do Family duty? S’life, you drank down all my Love, all my
Prudence too; Gad forgive me for it.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
Why, how the Devil cam’st thou to bear thy Liquor so ill? Ods my Life,
you drunk like a <i>Frenchman</i> new come to the University.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Morg.</span>
Pox, I can bear their drinking as well as any Man; but your
<i>London</i> way of Bousing and Politics does not agree with my
Constitution. Look ye, Cousin, <a class = "notes" name =

"#brother_textnote11">set quietly to’t, and I’ll stand my ground; but to
have screaming Whores, noisy</a> Bullies, rattling Dice, swearing and
cursing Gamesters, Couz. turns the Head of a Country-Drinker, more than
the Wine.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
Oh! Use, Cousin, will make an able Man.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Morg.</span>
Use, Cousin! Use me no Uses; for if ever you catch me at your damn’d
Clubs again, I’ll give you my Mother for a Maid: Why, you talk downright
Treason.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
Treason, ay&mdash;</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Morg.</span>
Ah Cousin, why, we talk’d enough to&mdash;hang us all.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
My honest Country-Couz. when wilt thou understand the <i>Guelphs</i>,
and the <i>Gibelins</i>, and learn to
<span class = "pagenum">333</span>
talk Treason o’ this side the Law? bilk a Whore without remorse; break
Windows, and not pay for ’em; drink your Bottle without asking
Questions; kill your Man without letting him draw; play away your Money
without fear of your Spouse, and stop her Mouth by undermining her
Nose?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Morg.</span>
Come, come, look you, Cousin, one word of Advice now I’m sober; what the
Devil should provoke thee and me to put ourselves on our twelve
Godfathers for a Frolick? We who have Estates. I&nbsp;shou’d be loth to
leave the World with a scurvy Song, composed by <a class = "comm" name =

"#brother_commnote9">the Poet <i>Sternhold</i></a>.</p>

<p class = "entrance">
Enter at the Door Sir <em>Rowland</em>, hearkning.</p>

<p>Or why, d’ye see, shou’d I expose my Noddle to the <a class = "comm"

<i>Roundhouse</i>, when I may go to bed in a whole skin with my Lady
Wife?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
Gad, Sir <i>Morgan</i>, thou hast sometimes pretty smart satirical
Touches with thee; use but <a class = "comm" name = "brother_commtag11"
id = "brother_commtag11" href = "#brother_commnote11"><i>Will’s</i>
Coffee-house</a> a little, and with thy Estate, and that Talent, thou
mayst set up for a Wit.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Morg.</span>
Mercy upon me, Sir <i>Merlin</i>, thou art stark mad: What, I&nbsp;a
Wit! I&nbsp;had rather be one of your Rakehells: for, look ye,
a&nbsp;Man may swear and stare, or so; break Windows, and Drawers Heads,
or so; unrig a needy Whore, and yet keep one’s Estate: but should I turn
Wit, ’twere impossible; for a Wit with an Estate is like a Prisoner
among the Cannibals.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
How so, good Sir <i>Morgan</i>?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Morg.</span>
Why, the needy Rogues only feed him with Praise, to fatten him for their
Palates, and then devour him.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
I applaud your choice, Cousin; for what Man of Bravery wou’d not prefer
a Rake to a Wit? The one enjoys the Pleasures the other can only rail
at; and that not out of Conscience, but Impotence: for alas! a&nbsp;Wit
has no quarrel to Vice in Perfection, but what the
<span class = "pagenum">334</span>
Fox had to the Grapes; he can’t play away his hundred Pound at sight;
<a class = "comm" name = "brother_commtag12" id = "brother_commtag12" href
= "#brother_commnote12">his Third Day</a> won’t afford it; and therefore
he rails at Gamesters; Whores shun him, as much as Noblemen, and for the
same cause, Money; those care not to sell their Carcases for a Sonnet,
nor these to scatter their Guineas, to be told an old Tale of a Tub,
they were so well acquainted with before.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Morg.</span>
What’s that, Sir <i>Merlin</i>?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
Why, their Praise;&mdash;for the Poet’s Flattery seldom reaches the
Patron’s Vanity; and what’s too strong season’d for the rest of the
World, is too weak for their Palates.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Morg.</span>
Why, look ye, Cousin, you’re a shreud Fellow: Whence learn’d you this
Satire? for I’m sure ’tis none of thy own; for I shou’d as soon suspect
thee guilty of good Nature, as Wit.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
I scorn it; and therefore I confess I stole the Observation from a Poet;
but the Devil pick his Bones for diverting me from the noble Theme of
Rakehells.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Morg.</span>
Noble Theme, Sir <i>Merlin</i>! look ye, d’ye see: Don’t mistake me,
I&nbsp;think ’tis a very scurvy one; and I wou’d not have your Father
know that you set up for such a Reprobate; for Sir <i>Rowland</i> would
certainly disinherit thee.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Mer.</span>
O, keep your musty Morals to your self, good Country Couz; they’ll do
you service to your <i>Welch</i> Criminals, for stealing an Hen, or
breaking up a Wenches Inclosure, or so, Sir <i>Morgan</i>; but for me,
I&nbsp;despise ’em: I&nbsp;have not been admitted into the Family of the
<i>Rakehellorums</i> for this, Sir: Let my Father drink old <a class =

is settled on me: and for the rest, I’l trust Dame <i>Fortune</i>; and
pray to the Three Fatal Sisters to cut his rotten Thred in two, before
he thinks of any such Wickedness.</p>

here&mdash;this unintelligible graceless Rascal here, will needs set up
for a Rakehell, when there’s scarce such a thing in the Nation, above an
Ale-draper’s Son; and chuses to be aukardly out of fashion, merely for
the sake of Tricking and Poverty; and keeps company with the senseless,
profane, lazy, idle, noisy, groveling Rascals, purely for the sake of

Hold, hold, good Uncle; my Cousin has been only drawn in, a&nbsp;little

Sense too; hates both

Swear, for thou’rt damn’d already, and by what black Degrees I will
unfold: When first I saw this gay, this glorious Mischief, though nobly
born, ’twas hid in mean Obscurity; the shining Viper lay half dead with
Poverty, I&nbsp;took it up, and laid it next my Heart, fed it, and
call’d its faded Beauties back.</p>

rais’d my Hopes to all distracting Love cou’d wish&mdash;that very
Night&mdash;Oh, let me rave and die, and never think that Disappointment

<p><span class = "speaker">Mir.</span>
What, you saw me courted at the Ball, perhaps.</p>

Hast thou took care wisely to teach me all the Arts of Life, and dost

Lady, that can serve your Interest, you swear

Well said; take off thy Veil, and shew the Jilt.</p>

You never knew a Woman thrive so well by real Love, as by Dissimulation:
This has a thousand Arts and Tricks to conquer; appears in any Shape, in
any Humour; can laugh or weep, be coy or play, by turns, as suits the
Lover best, while simple Love has only one Road of Sighs and Softness;
these to <i>Lejere</i> are due: But all my Charms, and Arts of gay
dissembling, are for the credulous Prince.&mdash;Ha&mdash;he’s
here!&mdash;and with him the dear Youth that has enslav’d me, who

<i>Collonel Codrington.</i> Christopher Codrington (1668-1710) was born
at Barbadoes, and thence sent to England to be educated. In 1685 he
passed as a gentleman commoner to Christ Church, Oxford. Five years
later he was elected as a probationer fellow to All Souls. Here he
speedily became known for the catholicity and thoroughness of his
studies, and ‘soon acquir’d the deserv’d character of an accomplished,
well-bred gentleman, and an universal scholar’. He was already an
enthusiastic bibliophile. In 1694 he followed William III to Flanders,
and having fought with great gallantry at Hay and Namur in 1695,
received various military distinctions. In the same year he attended the
King to Oxford, and pronounced the university oration on this royal
visit. There are dedications to him by Creech, Dennis, and others, but
it has been pertinently remarked that ‘his fame is rather to be
inferred’ hence ‘than from actually existent performances on his part’,
albeit we have copies of complimentary verses (e.g. prefixed to Garth’s
<i>Dispensary</i>) from his pen. In 1697 he succeeded his father as
commander-in-chief of the Leeward Isles. He does not seem to have been
popular, and resigned in 1703, retiring to a life of seclusion and study
on his Barbadoes estate. He died 7 April, 1710, and his body was brought
back to England to be buried in All Souls’ chapel. To this college he
left £10,000, and £6,000 worth of books, a&nbsp;legacy which built,
furnished and endowed the magnificent Codrington library there.</p>

<i>Mr. Verbruggen’s reading some of his part.</i> One may remember the
incident recorded by Pepys (2&nbsp;February, 1669), how, after Kynaston
had been assaulted by Sedley’s bravos, and was too ill to appear, the
young actor’s rôle was ‘done by Beeston, who is fain to read it out of a
book all the while and thereby spoils the part, and almost the play, it
being one of the best parts in it.... But it was pleasant to see Beeston
come in with others, supposing it to be dark, and yet he is forced to
read his part by the light of the candles: and this I observing to a
gentleman that sat by me, he was mightily pleased therewith, and spread
it up and down.’</p>

<i>grave Sir Roger.</i> ‘Sir Roger’ was a common nickname for any
clergyman from the well-known comic character ‘Sir Roger, Curate to the
<span class = "pagenum notes">420</span>
Lady’, in Beaumont and Fletcher’s popular <i>The Scornful Lady</i>. This
excellent play, a&nbsp;rare favourite with Restoration audiences, kept
the boards until the death of Mrs. Oldfield in 1730. After the great
actress’ demise it would seem that none of her successors ventured to
attempt the title-rôle, hence the piece soon fell out of the repertory.
In 1783, however, an alteration, made by Cooke the barrister for Mrs.
Abington, was produced with great success at Covent Garden. In this
meagre adaptation the Curate disappears. Shanks originally acted this
part, but Lacy was the acknowledged ‘Sir Roger’ in Restoration days.</p>

<i>Mr. Motteux.</i> Peter Anthony Motteux was a French Hugenot who came
to England upon the restoration of the Edict of Nantes (1685). He soon
mixed with the gayest society, and became well known as a prolific
writer of songs, prologues, epilogues, masques, and the lighter dramatic
fare. Much of this work is not lacking in wit and volatile smartness,
but it is all far too ephemeral to have any permanent value as
literature. He edited <i>The Gentleman’s Journal</i>, but is perhaps
best remembered for his translation of <i>Don Quixote</i>, and his
concluding Urquhart’s version of Rabelais.</p>

<i>a Termer.</i> Originally a frequenter of the law courts, and as many
came up from the country to London during term time on legal business,
it occasionally (as here) signified an unsophisticated stranger. In
Dryden’s <i>Sir Martin Mar-All</i> (1667), i, Mrs. Millicent, newly
arrived from Canterbury, replies to Lady Dupe’s greeting, ‘I came up,
Madam, as we country-gentlewomen use at an Easter term, to the
destruction of tarts and cheese cakes, to see a new play, buy a new
gown, take a turn in the Park, and so down again to sleep with my
forefathers.’ In Mountford’s farce, <i>Dr. Faustus</i> (4to 1697, but
produced at the Theatre Royal November-December, 1685, or very early in
1686), we have Scaramouch asking what practice the Doctor has, and
Harlequin replies: ‘Why his Business is to patch up rotten Whores
against the Term for Country Lawyers and Attorneys Clerks; and against
<i>Christmas</i>, <i>Easter</i>, and <i>Whitsun</i> Holidays, for City
Apprentices.’ cf. Southerne’s <i>Oroonoko</i> (1696), i, <span class =
"smallroman">I</span>, when Charlot Welldon says to her sister Lucia,
‘Nay, the young Inns-of-Court beaus, of but one Term’s standing in the
fashion, who knew nobody but as they were shown ’em by the orange-women,
had nicknames for us.’ More often a Termer meant ‘A person, whether male
or female, who resorted to London in term time only, for the sake of
tricks to be practised, or intrigues to be carried on at that period.’

<i>the Country of True Love.</i> Mrs. Behn, an omnivorous reader of
romances, was thinking of the celebrated <i>Carte de Tendre</i>
(Loveland), to be found in Mlle. de Scudéri’s <i>Clélie</i> (1654, Vol.
I, p.&nbsp;399), and reproduced in the English folio edition of 1678.
This fantastic map, which is said to have been suggested by Chapelain,
aroused unbounded ridicule. In scene <span class =
"smallroman">IV</span> of Molière’s <i>Les Précieuses Ridicules</i>
(1659), Cathos cries, ‘Je m’en vais gager qu’ils n’ont jamais vu la
carte de Tendre, et que Billets-Doux, Petits-Soins, Billets-Galante, et
Jolis-Vers sont des terres inconnues pour eux.’ This imaginary land is
divided by the River of Inclination: on the one side are the towns of
Respect, Generosity, A&nbsp;Great Heart, and the like; on the other
Constant Friendship, Assiduity, Submission, &amp;c. Across the Dangerous
Sea another continent is marked, ‘Countreys undiscovered.’ <i>Terra
Incognita.</i></p>

<p>The extravagant penchant for romances of the Scudéri
<i>Parthenissa</i> school was amply satirized by Steele in his clever
comedy <i>The Tender Husband</i> (1705), and as late as 1752 by Mrs.
Charlotte Lennox in <i>The Female Quixote</i>, an amusing novel.</p>

A&nbsp;waxen figure of the deceased, dressed in the habit worn whilst

he begged her to continue to wear her hair in the same way. This set the

<i>Towers.</i> The tower at this time was a curled frontlet of false
hair. cf. Crowne’s <i>The Country Wit</i> (1675), Act ii,&nbsp;<span
class = "smallroman">II</span>, where Lady Faddle cries to her maid,
‘run to my milliner’s for my gloves and essences ... run for my new
towre.’ Shadwell, <i>The Virtuoso</i> (1676), Act iii, mentions ‘Tires
for the head, locks, tours, frouzes, and so forth’. <i>The Debauchee</i>
(1677), Act ii,&nbsp;<span class = "smallroman">I</span>: Mrs. Saleware
speaks of buying ‘fine clothes, and tours, and Points and knots.’ <i>The
Younger Brother</i> (1696), Act v, the last scene, old Lady Youthly
anxiously asks her maid, ‘is not this Tour too brown?’ During the reign
of Mary II and particularly in the time of Anne a Tower meant almost
exclusively the high starched head-dress in vogue at that period.</p>
