<h4><a name = "patient_arg" id = "patient_arg">ARGUMENT.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">Sir</span> Patient Fancy, a hypochondriacal
old alderman, has taken a second wife, Lucia, a&nbsp;young and beautiful
woman who, although feigning great affection and the strictest conjugal
fidelity, intrigues with a gallant, Charles Wittmore, the only obstacle
to their having long since married being mutual poverty. However, the
jealousy and uxoriousness of the doting husband give the lovers few
opportunities; on one occasion, indeed, as Lady Fancy is entertaining
Wittmore in the garden they are surprised by Sir Patient, and she is
obliged to pass her visitor off under the name of Fainlove as a suitor
to her step-daughter, Isabella, in which rôle he is accepted by Sir
Patient. But Isabella has betrothed herself to Lodwick, a&nbsp;son of
the pedantic Lady Knowell: whilst Lucretia Knowell loves Leander, the
alderman’s nephew, in spite of the fact that she is promised by her
mother to Sir Credulous Easy, a&nbsp;bumpkinly knight from Devonshire.
Lodwick, who is a close friend of Leander, has been previously known to
Sir Credulous, and resolving to trick and befool the coxcomb warmly
welcomes him on his arrival in town. He persuades him, in fine, to give
a ridiculous serenade, or, rather, a&nbsp;hideous hubbub, of noisy
instruments under his mistress’ window. A&nbsp;little before this Lady
Knowell with a party of friends has visited Sir Patient, who is her next
neighbour, and the loud laughter, talking, singing and foppery so enrage
the precise old valetudinarian that he resolves to leave London
immediately for his country house, a&nbsp;circumstance which would be
fatal to his wife’s amours. Wittmore and she, however, persuade him that
he is very ill, and on being shown his face in a looking-glass that
magnifies instead of in his ordinary mirror, he imagines that he is
suddenly swollen and puffed with disease, and so is led lamenting to
bed, leaving the coast clear for the nonce. Isabella, however, has made
an assignation with Lodwick at the same time that her stepmother eagerly
awaits her own gallant, and in the dark young Knowell is by mistake
escorted to Lucia’s chamber, whilst Wittmore encountering Isabella, and
thinking her Lady Fancy, proceeds to act so amorously that the error is
soon discovered and the girl flies from his ardour. In her hurry,
however, she rushes blundering into Lucia’s bedchamber, where she finds
Knowell. It is just at this moment that Sir Credulous Easy’s deafening
fanfare re-echoes in the street, and Sir Patient, awakened and
half-stunned by the pandemonium, is led grouty and bawling into his
wife’s room, where he discovers Knowell, whom Lucia has all this time
taken for Wittmore; but her obvious confusion and dismay thereon are
such that Sir Patient does not suspect the real happenings, which she
glozes over with a tale concerning Isabella. Meantime the serenaders are
dispersed and routed by a band of the alderman’s servants and clerks.
Sir Credulous courting Lucretia, who loathes him, meets Knowell bringing
a tale of a jealous rival able to poison at a distance by means of some
strangely subtle venom, upon which the Devonshire knight conceals
himself in a basket, hoping to be conveyed away to
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
his old uncle in Essex, whereas he is merely transported next door. Sir
Patient, who surprises his lady writing a love-letter, which she turns
off by appending Isabella’s name thereto, is so overwhelmed with her
seeming affection and care for his family that he presents her with
eight thousand pounds in gold and silver, and resolves to marry his
daughter to Fainlove (Wittmore) without any further delay. But whilst he
is gone down to prayers and Lucia is entertaining her lover, the old
nurse informs him that his little daughter Fanny has long been privy to
an intrigue between Knowell and Isabella, whereupon, in great
perturbation, he rushes upstairs again to consult with his wife, who
hurries Wittmore under the bed. Sir Patient, however, warmed with
cordials which he quaffs to revive his drooping spirits, does not offer
to quit the chamber, but lies down on the bed, and the gallant is only
enabled to slip out unobserved after several accidents each of which
nearly betrays his presence. Upon the marriage morning Isabella in a
private interview rejects her pseudo-suitor with scorn and contumely,
whereat Knowell, who has of intent been listening, reveals to her that
it is his friend Wittmore and no real lover who is seemingly courting
her, and with his help, whilst Sir Patient is occupied with a
consultation of doctors (amongst whom Sir Credulous appears disguised as
a learned member of the faculty), Isabella and Knowell are securely
married. Lady Knowell, who has feigned a liking for Leander, generously
gives him to Lucretia, Sir Patient’s attention being still engrossed by
the physicians who assemble in great force. Soon after, at Leander’s
instigation, in order to test his wife, Sir Patient feigns to be dead of
a sudden apoplexy, and for a few moments, whilst others are present,
Lucia laments him with many plaints and tears, but immediately changes
when she is left alone with Wittmore. The lovers’ plans, however, are
overheard by the husband, who promptly confronts his wife with her
duplicity. Amazed and confounded indeed, he forgives Leander and his
daughter for marrying contrary to his former wishes; and when Lucia
coolly announces her intention to play the hypocrite and puritan no
more, but simply to enjoy herself with the moneys he has settled on her
without let or proviso, he humorously declares he will for his part also
drop the prig and canter, and turn town gallant and spark.</p>


<h4><a name = "patient_source" id = "patient_source">SOURCE.</a></h4>

<p><span class = "firstword">In</span> spite of Mrs. Behn’s placid
assertion in her address ‘To the Reader’ that she has only taken ‘but a
very bare hint’ from a foreign source, <i>Le Malade Imaginaire</i>, the
critics who cried out that <i>Sir Patient Fancy</i> ‘was made out of at
least four French plays’ are patently right. Sir Patient is, of course,
Argan throughout and in detail; moreover, in the scene where the old
alderman feigns death, there is very copious and obvious borrowing from
Act iii of <i>Le Malade Imaginaire</i>. Some of the doctors’ lingo also
comes from the third and final interlude of Molière’s comedy, whilst the
idea of the medical consultation is pilfered from <i>L’Amour
Médecin</i>, Act ii, <span class = "smallroman">II</span>. Sir Credulous
Easy is Monsieur de Porceaugnac, but his first entrance is taken
wholesale from Brome’s <i>The Damoiselle; or, The New Ordinary</i> (8vo,
1653), Act ii, <span class = "smallroman">I</span>, where Amphilus and
Trebasco discourse exactly as do Curry and his master. The pedantic Lady
Knowell is a mixture of Philaminte and
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
Bélise from <i>Les Femmes Savantes</i>. The circumstance in Act iv,
<span class = "smallroman">II</span>, when Lucia, to deceive her
husband, appends Isabella’s name to the love-letter she has herself just
written, had already been used by Wycherley at the commencement of Act v
of that masterpiece of comedy, <i>The Country Wife</i> (4to, 1675,
produced in 1672), where Mrs. Pinchwife, by writing ‘your slighted
Alithea’ as the subscription of a letter, completely befools her
churlish spouse.</p>

<p>Molière’s comedies, which were so largely conveyed in <i>Sir Patient
Fancy</i>, have been a gold mine for many of our dramatists. From <i>Le
Malade Imaginaire</i> Miller took his <i>Mother-in-Law; or, The Doctor
the Disease</i>, produced at the Haymarket, 12 February, 1734, and Isaac
Bickerstaffe, <i>Dr. Last in his Chariot</i>, produced at the same
theatre 25 August, 1769. In this farce Bickerstaffe further introduces
the famous consultation scene from <i>L’Amour Médecin</i>, a&nbsp;play
which had been made use of by Lacy, <i>The Dumb Lady; or, The Farrier
made a Physician</i> (1672); by Owen Swiney, <i>The Quacks; or, Love’s
the Physician</i>, produced at Drury Lane, 18 March, 1705; by Miller,
<i>Art and Nature</i>, produced at the same theatre 16 February, 1738;
and in an anonymous one act piece, which is little more than a bare
translation under the title <i>Love is the Doctor</i>, performed once
only at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, 4 April, 1734.</p>

<p><i>Monsieur de Pourceaugnac</i> supplied Ravenscroft with material no
less than three times. In <i>Mamamouchi; or, The Citizen turn’d
Gentleman</i>, acted early in 1672, we have Sir Simon Softhead, who is
Pourceaugnac in detail; in <i>The Careless Lovers</i>, produced at the
Duke’s House in 1673, and again in <i>The Canterbury Guests; or,
A&nbsp;Bargain Broken</i>, played at the Theatre Royal in 1694, we have
<i>in extenso</i> Act ii, Scenes <span class = "smallroman">VIII</span>,
<span class = "smallroman">IX</span>, <span class =
"smallroman">X</span>, of the French comedy. Crowne’s Sir Mannerley
Shallow (<i>The Country Wit</i>, 1675) comes from the same source.
<i>Squire Trelooby</i>, produced at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, 20 March,
1704, and revived as <i>The Cornish Squire</i> at Drury Lane, 3 January,
1734, is ascribed to Vanbrugh, Congreve, and Walsh; but this, as well as
a farce produced at Dublin in 1720 by Charles Shadwell and entitled
<i>The Plotting Lovers; or, The Dismal Squire</i>, cannot claim to be
anything but translations. Miller’s <i>Mother-in-Law</i>, again,
includes much of <i>Monsieur de Pourceaugnac</i>; and Thomas Sheridan’s
<i>Captain O’Blunder; or, The Brave Irishman</i>, produced at Goodman’s
Fields, 31 January, 1746, is a poor adaptation. Mrs. Parsons abbreviated
Molière to <i>The Intrigues of a Morning</i>, played at Covent Garden,
18 April, 1792, a&nbsp;jejune effort. <i>Les Femmes Savantes</i> was
rather racily transformed by Thomas Wright into <i>The Female
Virtuosoes</i>, and produced at Drury Lane in 1693. It was revived as
<i>No Fools like Wits</i> at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, 10 January, 1721, to
anticipate Cibber’s <i>The Refusal; or, The Ladies’ Philosophy</i>,
which had a run of six nights. Miller, in his <i>The Man of Taste</i>,
once more had resource to Molière. His play was produced at Drury Lane,
6 March, 1735. It has no value.</p>

<p>Of all these borrowers Mrs. Behn is infinitely the best. <i>Sir
Patient Fancy</i> is, indeed, an excellent comedy, and had she used more
leisure might have been improved to become quite first rate. Perhaps she
plagiarized so largely owing to the haste with which her play was
written and staged, but yet <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘eveything’">everything</ins> she touched has been invested with
an irresistible humour. A&nbsp;glaring example of her hurry remains in
the fact that the ‘precise clerk’
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
of Sir Patient has a double nomenclature. In Act iii he appears as Abel;
in Act iv, <span class = "smallroman">III</span>, he is referred to as
Bartholomew, and under this last name has an exit marked in Act v. This
character is only on the stage twice and is given but some three or four
lines to speak. Obviously, when writing her fourth act, Aphra forgot she
had already christened him.</p>


<h4><a name = "patient_hist" id = "patient_hist">THEATRICAL
HISTORY.</a></h4>

<p><i>Sir Patient Fancy</i> was produced at the Duke’s Theatre, Dorset
Garden, in January, 1678, with an exceptionally strong cast which
included both Betterton and his wife. It met with the great success it
fully deserved. The critics, indeed, were not slow to detect Mrs. Behn’s
plagiarisms, but the only real opposition was negligible disapproval of
a modest clique, who a few years later vainly tried to damn <i>The Lucky
Chance</i>. After the death of the two famous comedians Antony Leigh and
James Nokes in December, 1692, <i>Sir Patient Fancy</i>, owing to the
inability of succeeding actors to sustain the two rôles, Sir Patient and
Sir Credulous, which had been created by this gifted pair, completely
dropped out of the repertory of the theatre. It was not singular in its
fate, for Cibber expressly tells us that D’Urfey’s excellent comedy
<i>The Fond Husband</i>, and Crowne’s satirical <i>City Politics</i>,
‘lived only by the extraordinary performance of Nokes and Leigh.’</p>

<p>I Printed this Play with all the impatient haste one ought to do, who
would be vindicated from the most unjust and silly aspersion, Woman
could invent to cast on Woman; and which only my being a Woman has
procured me; <i>That it was Baudy</i>, the least and most Excusable
fault in the Men writers, to whose Plays they all crowd, as if they came
to no other end than to hear what they condemn in this: <i>but from a
Woman it was unnaturall</i>: but how so Cruell an unkindness came into
their imaginations I can by no means guess; unless by those whose Lovers
by long absence, or those whom Age or Ugliness have rendered a little
distant from those things they would fain imagin here&mdash;But if such
as these durst profane their Chast ears with hearing it over again, or
taking it into their serious Consideration in their Cabinets; they would
find nothing that the most innocent Virgins can have cause to blush at:
but confess with me that no Play either Ancient or Modern has less of
that Bug-bear Bawdry in it. Others <a class = "comm" name =
"patient_commtag1" id = "patient_commtag1" href =
"#patient_commnote1">to show their breeding (as <i>Bays</i> sayes)</a>
cryed it was made out of at least four <i>French</i> Plays, when I had
but a very bare hint from one, the <i>Malad Imagenere</i>, which was
given me translated by a Gentleman infinitely to advantage; but how much
of the <i>French</i> is in this, I&nbsp;leave to those who do indeed
understand it and have seen it at the Court. The play had no other
Misfortune but that of coming out for a Womans: had it been owned by a
Man, though the most Dull Unthinking Rascally Scribler in Town, it had
been a most admirable Play. Nor does it’s loss of Fame with the Ladies
do it much hurt, though they ought to have had good Nature and justice
enough to have attributed all its faults to the Authours unhappiness,
who is forced to write for Bread and not ashamed to owne it, and
consequently ought to write to please (if she can) an Age which has
given severall proofs it was by this way of writing to be obliged,
though it is a way too cheap for men of wit to pursue who write for
Glory, and a way which even I despise as much below me.</p>

plague all young Women of Quality.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Lucr.</span>
Yet these are the precious things our grave Parents still chuse out to
make us happy with, and all for a filthy Jointure, the undeniable
argument for our Slavery to Fools.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Isab.</span>
Custom is unkind to our Sex, not to allow us free Choice; but we above
all Creatures must be forced to endure the formal Recommendations of a

the Obedient Daughter stands&mdash;thus&mdash;with her Hands pinn’d
before her, a&nbsp;set Look, few Words, and a Mein that cries&mdash;Come

Spare the Relation, for I have observ’d of late your Mother to have
order’d her Eyes with some softness, her Mouth endeavouring to sweeten
it self into Smiles and Dimples, as if she meant to recal Fifteen again,
and gave it all to <i>Leander</i>, for at him she throws her Darts.</p>

Is’t possible thou should’st have perceived it already?</p>

This <i>Devonshire</i> Knight too, who is recommended to my Mother as a
fit Husband for me, I&nbsp;shall be so tormented with&mdash;My Brother
swears he’s the pertest, most unsufferable Fool he ever saw; when he was
at my Uncle’s last Summer, he made all his Diversion.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Isab.</span>
Prithee let him make ours now, for of all Fops your Country Fop is the

<p><span class = "speaker">Lucr.</span>
And are the most noisy, keeping Fops.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Isab.</span>
Keeping begins to be as ridiculous as Matrimony, and is a greater
Imposition upon the Liberty of Man; the Insolence and Expence of their
Mistresses has almost tir’d out all but the Old and Doting part of
Mankind: The rest begin to know their value, and set a price upon a good
Shape, a&nbsp;tolerable Face and Mein:&mdash;and some there are who have
made excellent Bargains for themselves that way, and will flatter ye and
jilt ye an Antiquated Lady as artfully as the most experienc’d Miss of
’em all.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Lod.</span>
All this, Sir, we suspected, and smok’d your borrowing Money last night;

<p><span class = "speaker">Wit.</span>
Did you not rob me of the Victory then I’ve been so long a toiling
for?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Lod.</span>
If I had, ’twould not have made her guilty, nor me a Criminal; she
taking me for one she lov’d, and I her for one that had no Interest in
my Friend: and who the Devil wou’d have refus’d so fine a Woman? Nor had
I but that I was prevented by her Husband.&mdash;But <i>Isabella</i>,
Sir, you must resign.</p>

Look ye, I am a damn’d dull Fellow at Invention, I’ll therefore leave
you to contrive matters by your selves, whilst I’ll go try how kind
Fortune will be to me this Morning, and see in what readiness my Bride
is. What you do must be thought on suddenly; I’ll wait on you anon, and

What was this long Whisper, something about me?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Lod.</span>
Why, yes, faith, I was persuading him to speak to his Friend about this
Business; but he swears there’s no hopes of a Reconciliation: you are a
dead Man, unless some cleanly conveyance of you be soon thought on.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Cred.</span>
Why, I’ll keep within doors, and defy Malice and foul Weather.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Lod.</span>
Oh, he means to get a Warrant, and search for stolen Goods, prohibited

<span class = "stagedir">
They both pause a while.</span></p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Cred.</span>

What is’t?</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Lod.</span>
Be serious, Sir, this is no laughing matter; if I might advise, you
should steal into the Country, for two or three days, till the Business
be blown over.</p>

<p><span class = "speaker">Sir Cred.</span>
Lord, thou art so hasty and conceited of thy own Invention, thou wilt
not give a Man leave to think in thy company: why, these were my very

<p><span class = "firstword">Frederick</span>, ‘the Amorous Prince,’ a
mercurial young gallant, son to the Duke of Florence, under a solemn
promise of marriage debauches Cloris, sister to his friend and
confidant, Curtius. The girl has always led a secluded country life, and
this relationship is unknown to the Prince, who upon hearing the praises
of Laura, beloved by Curtius, straightway resolves to win this lady
also. Laura’s brother Lorenzo, a&nbsp;wanton madcap favourite of
Frederick’s, gladly effects the required introduction, and when Curtius
interrupts and forbids, Salvator, father to Laura and Lorenzo, promptly
turns the quondam lover out of the house. Lorenzo himself is idly
pursuing Clarina, wife to a certain Antonio, an abortive intrigue
carried on to his own impoverishment, but the enrichment of Isabella,
Clarina’s woman, a&nbsp;wench who fleeces him unmercifully. Antonio
being of a quaint and jealous humour would have his friend Alberto make
fervent love to Clarina, in order that by her refusals and chill denials
her spotless conjugal fidelity may be proved. However, Ismena, Clarina’s
sister, appears in a change of clothes as the wife, and manifold
complications ensue, but eventually all is cleared and Ismena accepts
Alberto, whom she has long loved; not before Isabella, having by a trick
compelled Lorenzo to declare himself her husband, enforces the bargain.
Cloris, meanwhile, disguised as a boy under the name of Philibert,
attaches herself to Frederick, first succouring him when he is wounded
in a duel by Curtius. Curtius to avenge his wrongs disguises himself,
and as a pandar entices Frederick into a snare by promises of supplying
the amorous Prince with lovely cyprians. Bravos, however, are in
waiting, but these prove to be in the service of Antonio, who appears
with Alberto and their friends, completely frustrating the plot, whilst
Clarina, Ismena, and other ladies have acted the courtezans to deceive
Curtius, and at the same time read the Prince a salutary lesson. He
profits so much by this experience that he takes Cloris, whose sex is
discovered, to be his bride, whilst Laura bestows her hand on the
repentant and forgiven Curtius.</p>

<p><span class = "firstword">Mrs. Behn</span> has taken her episode of
Antonio’s persuading Alberto to woo Clarina from Robert Davenport’s fine
play, <i>The City Night-Cap</i> (4to 1661, but licensed 24 October,
1624) where Lorenzo induces Philippo to test Abstemia in the same way.
Astrea, however, has considerably altered the conduct of the intrigue.
Bullen (<i>The Works of Robert Davenport</i>, 1890) conclusively and
exhaustively demonstrates that Davenport made use of Greene’s popular
<i>Philomela; the Lady Fitzwater’s Nightingale</i> (1592, 1615, and
1631), wherein Count Philippo employs Giovanni Lutesio to ‘make
experience of his wife’s [Philomela’s] honesty’, rather than was under
<span class = "pagenum">120</span>
any obligation to Cervantes’ <i>Curioso Impertinente, Don Quixote</i>,
Book IV, ch. vi-viii. Read, Dunlop, and Hazlitt all had express’d the
same opinion. The Spanish tale turns upon the fact of Anselmo, the
Curious Impertinent, enforcing his friend Lothario to tempt his wife
Camilla. Such a theme, however, is common, and with variations is to be
found in Italian novelle. Recent authorities are inclined to suggest
that the plot of Beaumont and Fletcher’s <i>The Coxcomb</i> (1610), much
of which runs on similar lines, is not founded on Cervantes. Southerne,
in his comedy, <i>The Disappointment; or, The Mother in Fashion</i>
(1684) and ‘starch Johnny Crowne’ in <i>The Married Beau</i> (1694),
both comedies of no little wit and merit, are patently indebted to
<i>The Curious Impertinent</i>. Cervantes had also been used three
quarters of a century before by Nat Field in his <i>Amends for
Ladies</i> (4to, 1618), where Sir John Loveall tries his wife in an
exactly similar manner to Lorenzo, Count Philippo and Anselmo.</p>

<p>The amours of the Florentine court are Mrs. Behn’s own invention; but
the device by which Curtius ensnares Frederick is not unlike Vendice and
Hippolito’s trapping of the lecherous old Duke in <i>The Revenger’s
Tragedy</i> (4to, 1607), albeit the saturnine Tourneur gives the whole
scene a far more terrible and tragic catastrophe.</p>

<p>In January, 1537, Lorenzino de Medici having enticed Duke Alessandro
of Florence to his house under pretext of an assignation with a certain
Caterina Ginori, after a terrible struggle assassinated him with the aid
of a notorious bravo. Several plays have been founded upon this history.
Notable amongst them are Shirley’s admirable tragedy, <i>The Traitor</i>
(licensed May, 1631, 4to 1635) and in later days de Musset’s
<i>Lorenzaccio</i> (1834).</p>

<p>The Mask in Act v of <i>The Amorous Prince</i> is in its purport most
palpably akin to the Elizabethans.</p>


<h4><a name = "prince_hist" id = "prince_hist">THEATRICAL
HISTORY.</a></h4>

<p><i>The Amorous Prince</i> was produced by the Duke’s Company in the
spring of 1671 at their Lincoln’s Inn Fields theatre, whence they
migrated in November of the same year to the magnificent new house in
Dorset Garden. No performers’ names are given to the comedy, which met
with a very good reception. It seems to have kept the boards awhile, but
there is no record of any particular revival.</p>

<p>Attended only by my Confessor,</p>
<p>A Gentleman, a Passenger, in the same Boat,</p>
<p>Address’d himself to me;</p>
<p>And made a many little Courtships to me:</p>
<p>I being veil’d, he knew not who receiv’d them,</p>
<p>Nor what Confusion they begot in me.</p>
<p>At the first sight, I grew to great esteems of him,</p>

<p class = "speaker">
<span class = "speaker">Ism.</span>

<span class = "pagenum">209</span>
<p>And soon <i>Clarina</i> found I was a Lover,</p>
<p>Which I confess’d at last, and nam’d the Object.</p>
<p>She told me of your Friendship with <i>Antonio</i>,</p>
<p>And gave me hopes that I again should see you:</p>
<p>&mdash;But <i>Isabella</i> over-heard the Plot,</p>
<p>Which, Sir, <i>Antonio</i> did contrive with you,</p>

I&nbsp;carefully follow the metrical division of 4to 1671. 1724 prints
many speeches and whole scenes as prose which the quarto gives as verse.
It is noticeable that the edition of 1711 follows the quarto.</p>

<i>Cataline.</i> Jonson’s tragedy was revived with great splendour at
the King’s House, Friday, 18 December, 1668, and remained a stock play
until the retirement of Hart (who excelled in Catiline) at the Union in
1682. Michael Mohun was famous in Cethegus, and Mrs. Corey in Sempronia.
Pepys found the play itself rather dull as a whole ‘though most fine in
clothes, and a fine Scene of the Senate, and of a fight, as ever I saw
in my life.’ A&nbsp;year before its actual production his crony, Harry
Harris, a&nbsp;member of the rival theatre had ‘talked of
<i>Catiline</i> which is to be suddenly acted at the King’s House; and
there all agree that it cannot be well done at that house, there not
being good actors enough; and Burt acts Cicero, which they all conclude
he will not be able to do well. The King gives them £500 for robes,
there being, as they say, to be sixteen scarlet robes.’ (11 December,
1667.) In the first quarto (1672), of Buckingham’s <i>The Rehearsal</i>,
Bayes refers to <i>Catiline</i> saying that his design in a certain
scene is ‘<i>Roman</i> cloaths, guilded Truncheons, forc’d conceipt,
smooth Verse, and a Rant.’ The words ‘Roman cloaths’ are omitted in all
subsequent editions.</p>

<i>the Comick Hat.</i> In 1670 there was produced at the Theatre Royal,
Dryden’s <i>The Conquest of Granada</i>, Part <span class =
"smallroman">I</span>. The witty prologue was ‘spoken by Mrs. Ellen
Gwyn’ (who acted Almahide) ‘in a Broad-Brimm’d Hat, and Waist Belt’. It
commences thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>This jest was first of t’other house’s making,</p>
<p>And five times tried, has never fail’d of taking;</p>
<span class = "pagenum notes">414</span>
<p>For ’twere a shame a poet should be kill’d</p>
<p>Under the shelter of so broad a shield.</p>
<p>This is the hat, whose very sight did win ye</p>
<p>To laugh and clap as tho’ the devil were in ye.</p>
<p>As then, for Nokes, so now I hope you’ll be</p>
<p>So dull, to laugh, once more, for love of me.</p>
</div>

<p>Two slightly different explanations are given of the jest. Theatrical
tradition has it that Dryden supplied Nell Gwynne, who was plump and
petite, with this hat of the circumference of a cart wheel, in ridicule
of a hat worn by Nokes of the Duke’s company whilst playing Ancient
Pistol. It is again said that in May, 1670, whilst the Court was at
Dover to receive the Duchess of Orleans, the Duke’s Company played there
Shadwell’s <i>The Sullen Lovers</i>, and Caryl’s <i>Sir Salomon; or, The
Cautious Coxcomb</i>, in which latter comedy Nokes acted Sir Arthur
Addle, a&nbsp;bawling fop. The dress of the French gallants attending
the Duchess was characterised by an excessively short laced scarlet or
blue coat, a&nbsp;very broad waist-belt and a wide-leaved hat. Nokes
appeared on the stage in a still shorter coat, a&nbsp;huger waist-belt,
and a hat of preposterous dimensions. The Duke of Monmouth buckled his
own sword to the actor’s side, and, according to old Downes, our
comedian looked more like a dressed-up ape or a quiz on the French than
Sir Arthur Addle. The English Court was straightway convulsed with
laughter at this mimicry, which seems, to say the least, in highly
questionable taste. When Nell Gwynne appeared and burlesqued the biter,
Charles II, who was present at the first performance of <i>The Conquest
of Granada</i>, well nigh died of merriment, and her verve in delivering
Dryden’s witty lines wholly completed her conquest of the King. Nell
Gwynne did not appear on the boards after 1670.</p>

explains as ‘a small quantity of wine, ale, or spirits.’</p>

<h4>Cross-Reference</h4>

<p><a name = "prince_crossref5" id = "prince_crossref5" href =
"#prince_commnote5">Note to p. 121</a>: <i>The Jig and Dance.</i></p>

<p><i>Town Fop</i> note:</p>

<div class = "inset">
<p><i>A Jigg.</i> There were, in Post-Restoration times, two
interpretations of the word Jig. Commonly speaking it was taken to
mean exactly what it would now, a simple dance. Nell Gwynne and Moll
Davis were noted for the dancing of Jigs. cf. Epilogue to Buckingham’s
<i>The Chances</i> (1682):&mdash;</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p class = "indent2">The Author dreads the strut and meen</p>
<p>Of new prais’d Poets, having often seen</p>
<p>Some of his Fellows, who have writ before,</p>
<p>When Nel has danc’d her Jig, steal to the Door,</p>
<p>Hear the Pit clap, and with conceit of that</p>
<p>Swell, and believe themselves the Lord knows what.</p>
</div>

<p>Thus at the end of Lacy’s <i>The Old Troop</i> (31 July, 1668), we
have ‘a dance of two hobby horses in armour, and a Jig.’ Also shortly
before the epilogue in Shadwell’s <i>The Sullen Lovers</i> (1668) we
read, ‘Enter a Boy in the habit of Pugenello and traverses the stage,
takes his chair and sits down, then dances a Jig.’</p>

<p>But it must be remembered that beside the common meaning there was a
gloss upon the word derived from Elizabethan stage practice. In the
prologue to <i>The Fair Maid of the Inn</i> (licensed 1626), good plays
are spoken of as often scurvily treated, whilst</p>

<div class = "verse">
<p>A Jigge shall be clapt at, and every rhime</p>
<p>Prais’d and applauded by a clam’rous chyme.</p>
</div>

<p>The Pre-Restoration Jig was little other indeed than a ballad opera
in
embryo lasting about twenty-five minutes and given as an after-piece.
It was a rhymed farce in which the dialogue was sung or chanted by the
characters to popular ballad tunes. But after the Restoration the Jig
assumed a new and more serious complexion, and came eventually to be
dovetailed with the play itself, instead of being given at the fag end
of the entertainment. Mr. W.&nbsp;J. Lawrence, the well-known theatrical
authority to whom I owe much valuable information contained in this
note, would (doubtless correctly) attribute the innovation to Stapylton
and Edward Howard, both of whom dealt pretty freely in these Jigs.
Stapylton has in Act v of <i>The Slighted Maid</i> (1663) a ‘Song in
Dialogue’ between Aurora and Phoebus with a chorus of Cyclops, which
met with some terrible parody in <i>The Rehearsal</i> (cf. the present
editor’s edition of <i>The Rehearsal</i>, p.&nbsp;145). Indeed all
extrinsic songs in dialogue, however serious the theme, were considered
‘Jigs’. A striking example would be the Song of the Spirits in Dryden’s
<i>Tyrannic Love</i>, Act&nbsp;iv.</p>

<p>In Post-Restoration days a ballad sung in the streets by two persons
was frequently called a Jig, presumably because it was a ‘song in
dialogue’. Numerous examples are to be found amongst the Roxburgh
Ballads.</p>

<p>The Jig introduced in <i>Sir Timothy Tawdrey</i> would seem to have
been the simple dance although not improbably an epithalamium was also
sung.</p>
