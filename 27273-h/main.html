Arrangement of Editor’s Notes</a></h4>

<p>In the printed book, all notes were grouped at the end of the volume
as “Notes on the Plays” and “Notes: Critical and Explanatory”. For this
e-text, Notes have been placed after their respective plays.</p>

<p>The Notes as printed give only page and line numbers. References to
Acts and Scenes were added by the transcriber. All links lead directly
to the cited text. Annotated passages are identified in the body text
with two kinds of link: <a class = "notes" href = "#notes">dotted
underlining</a> for text notes; <a class = "comm" href = "#notes">solid
underlining</a> for critical notes. Passages that have both kinds of
note are linked to the “Critical and Explanatory” note.</p>

<p>The critical notes include a few cross-references to other volumes of
the Complete Works. Where appropriate, these texts are quoted after each
play’s Notes. The “N.E.D.” of the Notes is now generally known as the
OED.</p>

<p>In the Notes, the variation between .’ and ’. (close quote before or
after final period) is as printed and has not been regularized. The
abbreviation “cf.” is always lower-case. Brackets are in the
original.</p>
